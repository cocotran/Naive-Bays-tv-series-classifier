 crap 90's sitcom bit
 this just isn't creative and doesn't drive the plot forward. it's unecessary at best. still here but wondering why
 i've watched season 2 this far only because season 1 was so good. the writers don't seem to know what to do since the hackers accomplished their mission in season 1.most of season 2 has been spent inside elliot's head or introducing new characters that are annoying (fbi woman) or don't advance the main story (evil website guy and leon) or compromising angela. the writing has dropped off a cliff since the end of the first season.the only good part of season 2 for me has been seeing darlene and elliot coming up with the grand scheme of season 1. the beginning of this episode is the low point thus far of season 2. a 15 minute diversion that doesn't advance anything. i was waiting for it to end so something might meaningful might happen in the show's reality.it's getting harder to keep faith as this season continues (to go nowhere). from funny to too brutal
 spoiler alert, of course the following text can contain details from what happened on the show. so this episode really took me by surprise with the beginning as a family sitcom where elliot was just rolling his big eyes most of the time. but this was actually the better part of the episode, i even laughed a bit which since the first season happened very rarely. but when it came back to the normal resolution and reality it got worse. it really broke my heart how bad elliot ended up from helping that ray guy. like seriously isn't he already dealing with enough sh*t in his life? he has to get beat up like some street dog by this bunch of idiots who are selling guns and god knows what else online? i think you took it too far here sam! i am already hurting a lot watching elliot suffer through most of the time but this just got too violent. also angela is getting on my nerves,with her listening to the pathetic motivational crap all the time thinking that she can accomplish anything. it just makes her appear more stupid and naive than before. overall i am having hard time continuing to watch this show, but just for the awesome acting job by rami malek i will keep on watching. joanna coerces elliot to help her find tyrell as multiple characters maybe meeting death or jail time.
 trigger warning(s): gun shotsmain plot (with commentary)topic 1: an unlikely team (elliot & joanna)joanna's driver is a menacing man, and perhaps the sole reason elliot even entertains joanna. someone who, despite seemingly ready to divorce the man, is trying to claim how much she loves him and how this breathing on the phone must be him right? surely elliot, the master hacker, can find her husband? well, little does she know her husband is dead and she is a widow but mr. robot doesn't think it is smart to reveal such information. {commentary}as usual, joanna remains a bit of an outlier. to me, she is the only character who hasn't really become someone you get an emotional reaction of. she is still the hot wife, as is reinforced by her mostly appearing in sexual situations and not even in a femme fatale type of way. but maybe one day she may evolve. switching to elliot, the old boy has a few new toys thanks to joanna pushing him to help her. but what is perhaps noteworthy here is joanna's driver. this mysterious bodyguard dude has this vibe that he may be an undercover agent. one who could be, long term, trying to catch wind of where tyrell maybe and with elliot, thanks to hacking the nypd, gets a ping, off that man goes. leaving elliot to deal with an old friend.topic 2: the end of the line (cisco, angela, dominique, and darlene)it all had to catch up to them sooner or later right? cisco hanging with darlene, who is losing it and, as cisco says, has masqueraded as a leader and has done so terribly. after all, trenton and mobley have taken off to the wind, when vincent, one of the dc operatives, shows up her first thought seems to be letting him die, and it shows darlene has gone off the deep end. though all things considered, she may have been screwed up for a while. take for example how fondly she remembers being kidnapped and almost wishing she wasn't fond. for, outside of missing elliot, she liked the change of pace.well, it may be time for elliot to miss her. for, you see, with multiple people identifying cisco, and the fbi deciding to use the media to smoke him out, well the dark army possibly gets involved. we still can't say the men whose faces we never see are part of the dark army, but considering the same night cisco face is revealed they go to the diner he and darlene are at and shoot it up, needless to say, there is a likely chance these soldiers are the fingers of white rose. but who survived? well, dominique, after following many bread crumbs to find cisco and darlene, she makes it out alive. however, it isn't clear if the shooter got his target, much less darlene. so, it is going to be one of two things: either one or both will end up in the hospital or elliot might be planning a funeral. which will be the 2nd downer of the night for angela, under the alias claudia kincaid, reveals dominique is onto her and she is prepping to admit to her part in the f-society and 5/9 attacks. she isn't going to mention elliot or his friends, but she does want to know before it goes down, why did he start f-society? of which an answer isn't really given. however, with this being a real possible goodbye, for a while, a hug turns into a kiss and then comes what may be the final stop in their relationship. for once elliot gets off that empty train car, either the fbi or dark army get on and that leads to another character maybe at the end of the line.{commentary}will they actually kill off a lead character? gideon's death was a shock, but honestly, i forgot about it until i started thinking of who else died on this show. but gideon's death didn't send shock waves. his death seemed to just signify it was the end of his story and, at that point, he was just fat on the meat. when it comes to this situation, though, the people who might be killed, or imprisoned, are a bit more essential.granted, killing cisco would be the easy choice. but then you have to factor how darlene will react. arguably, even more so than elliot, cisco grounds her. yes, he may fight with her constantly, but he tries to gear her toward normalcy and chilling out. that is, as opposed to elliot who, in my opinion, perhaps took advantage of her need for his approval and companionship. hence why, when he disappeared, she took over. not because she perhaps fully believes in the goal to take down e-corp as he does, but because she knows this project is important to him and she doesn't want to have him have one less reason to come back.yet, honestly, it seems unlikely that either she or angela may be in mortal danger. for while this season has done its best to make a compelling twist and shock us, it hasn't really done it well. it has often picked the safest route and chosen whatever can best fill the episode order of the show. so for them to kill one of the two female leads, i don't think mr. robot, as a show, has the guts. highlightsdominique finally being on the brink of catching a member, and an accomplice, of f-society.low pointsjoanna's existence on this show feels purely as eye candy and not as an actual contributor.on the fencewhat will happen with angela, darlene, and cisco? are they about to die, go to jail, or will something else happen to them? we learn who kidnapped angela and elliot meets up with an old friend.
 overviewbecause of mr. robot's format, we are in a constant state of questioning what is real or not? heck, maybe even what is embellished or not. so when you see white rose, is she real? when elliot sees anyone, be it the characters we believe to be alive or otherwise, are they who they appear to be? we, as viewers, are in a constant state of trusting what our eyes see as we peer through a blindfold. but if that blindfold is ever untied, will we like what we see?trigger warning(s): child abusetopic 1: stalling (dominique)what happened to cisco and darlene? dominique notes because of santiago's call people died in the shootout, yet she also mentions wanting to handle the questioning before she is sent home. a place where you can tell, she tries to avoid being for too long for who is there but alexa? what is there besides reminders of how lonely and unfulfilling her personal life is?{commentary}i'm trying to understand the purpose of us seeing dom's personal life. granted, i often complain about underdeveloped characters, but really what was the point of reminding us how miserable she is outside of work? especially when it isn't showing a different facet to her loneliness or even show her pursuing trying to get out there? i mean, even if it showed her trying to befriend angela that would have been something better than nothing.topic 2: why is this girl so special? (angela & white rose)speaking of angela, rather than the fbi picking her up it's the dark army on white rose's orders. leading to a very strange, mini-angela asking angela weird questions like if she cries during sex to basic ones like her picking between two colors. all of it is just a preface for white rose deciding to appear and meet angela.why exactly? well, because she seems like the type who would have been dead a long time ago. in fact, white rose says she should have been 90 days ago but now, she is worth 28 minutes of white rose's time to understand what makes this girl so interesting. of which, between the washington township incident, the 5/9 attacks, and all that happened in between and since, seems to be what makes her amusing. to the point, white rose won't kill her as long as she stops interfering. which she is to convince herself of not doing whichever way she needs to.{commentary}angela's place on this chessboard which is mr. robot has her going back and forth between a back row piece to a pawn. which ultimately i realize is to the benefit to whoever she shares a scene with more than her. take wong as white rose for example.but, their shared scenes aside, you have to be left wondering what is angela foiling and does it deal with stage 2? is it that a nuclear meltdown of an e-corp asset is the goal? perhaps the power outs are supposed to open up the ability to really do some damage to the e- corp servers, especially as mr. price tries to position e-coin as a currency which can help the banking system recover? as with most theories, i bet you that in the season finale we will get a watered down answer if we get one at all.topic 3: can you believe your eyes? (elliot)what is it mr. robot sees? what is it he does while elliot is asleep, dazed, or left himself vulnerable enough to be taken over? well, with the glitches allowing elliot to see mr. robot as he possesses him, acts as him, elliot tries to consciously do as mr. robot does and become a silent watcher. something he does and this reveals tyrell? is he real? is he alive? elliot tries to get this answer from a 3rd party but with that person being a taxi driver with little patience, he isn't for elliot losing his mind over thinking tyrell is in the back seat.what really matters here though is tyrell says, per dark army, preparation for stage 2 is complete.{commentary}a part of me wants to believe tyrell is real. after all, mr. robot perhaps would need him to be real and elliot to believe he is dead so tyrell could work uninterrupted. plus, let's face it, when it comes to elliot's memory issues, more than likely mr. robot is the culprit of all that so that elliot can't stop whatever he has in motion. after all, be it elliot or the manifestation which is mr. robot, this is all about revenge more than anything else, even if elliot and darlene attempt to make it seem like it isn't. white rose pointed that out herself.but what is stage 2 remains in the air and why would tyrell be needed for it? fingers crossed, let's hope for some answers. highlightsthough mr. wong's performance on gotham is campy to the point he just blends in, as white rose he is too brilliant to not stand out. white rose is sarcastic yet not mean-spirited and has this air of mystery not only when it comes to her person but with how amused she is with the world. add in the complications of her dual life and you have to applaud mr. wong's work on this character for even if the foundation was excellent, he made her into a skyscraper worthy of awe.on the fenceto me, mr. robot should have remained at an episode order of 10 instead of 12. for really, what has been done with the extra time? granted, some of the filler, like the 90s sitcom version of mr. robot, was funny, but alongside that comes the arc featuring ray which, at this point, was purely a time killer. mr. robot finally became boring
 i've been a fan of the show since it started and recommended to everyone as the best show of all time, but personally i think sam esmail run out of ideas and has been watching black mirror too much. i'm 30 minutes into this episode and i'm annoyed by how the episode keeps running with side stories leaving elliot aside. i watch the show to see mr robot, not a messy fbi agent talking to her alexa about love. the conversation between whiterose and amanda is totally pointless. i sure can come out with a billion more creative ideas of how to mess up with a viewer mind instead of the whole locked in a door with a commodore. jumping the shark
 it's hard to write that title. i mean, for a show that is about hacking the fbi, and a nerd being desired by every beautiful women out there, is hard to say... but the angela story in this was... so disappointing... the season finale is more so a whimper than a roar as you are left feeling there should be one more episode left before the real finale.
 trigger warning(s): violence against a womantopic 1: happiness makes up in height for what it lacks in length (joanna)scott knowles (cto of e-corp) wanted revenge. so he impersonated tyrell hoping to force joanna to feel his pain. problem is, she isn't impressed and, unlike him, she isn't made weak by her disappointment. no, it makes her vicious and she notes how his wife was going to have an affair, that his unborn baby is better off dead than having him as a father, and it leads to scott snapping. he nearly kills her but stops. something he may wished he had done for joanna, it seems, is going to use derek to frame scott for his wife's death.{commentary}is it wrong i was hoping joanna was going to be killed off? her scene with scott seemed like the perfect sendoff but, alas, it seems season 3 she shall return for her revenge. all the while remaining in the shadow of being tyrell's wife, even after a full season without him.topic 2: let's be friends (dominique & darlene)it's a stalemate. dominque doesn't have the evidence she needs to manipulate darlene and darlene feels confident enough about her chances in prison to keep a tight lip. thus leaving dominique to hope her "good cop" or "let's be friends" tactic actually works on someone. for, as of now, while dominique has evidence, and pretty much knows most of the f-society's connections, without darlene all she has are dead bodies and missing persons.{commentary}with cisco dead, that leaves elliot as the one person who darlene not only trusts, but loves. so comes the question if she may sacrifice herself, thinking elliot will clear her record eventually, or if she'll work with dom solely to protect her brother. two scenarios which seem as unlikely as they could be options. for where else could they go with this storyline? besides the dark army swooping in and trying to kill everyone in that fbi location. which, while mind blowing, honestly would feel like a jumping the shark type moment.topic 3: can you trust yourself (elliot, mr. robot, and tyrell)stage 2 deals with killing the hope of mr. price rebuilding the database by destroying all the physical records of e-corp. all of which, from across the country, are being shipped to one central location. all that has to be done is use the backdoor elliot created, use the femcell he also made, then overload the ups systems to release a gas which, when they explode, will cause a fire and level the building and everyone in it.which is the problem for elliot – the death of people. making it so as he realizes what mr. robot has planned with multiple parties, including what he believes is a fake tyrell, he tries to stop them both. leading to the truth being revealed: tyrell is alive. he shoots elliot with the gun mr. robot gave him for no one is supposed to be allowed to stop the project, even himself (elliot/mr. robot).so, as elliot lies on the ground, bleeding out, tyrell calls angela and with that she calmly reassures tyrell and we begin to realize that mr. robot has planned farther ahead than given credit for. he has made use of elliot's body in ways we can't truly fathom and he somehow has even got angela wrapped around his finger.{commentary}as interesting as stage 2 seems you know it isn't going to happen, leading to the only interesting thing here being angela's role in all this. who prepped her, why did she accept, and could it just be she has become a dark army soldier for protection? outside of that, you have to wonder if that bullet maybe all elliot needed to get rid of mr. robot. someone who flickers like a glitch, post-gunshot, until he eventually disappears.but if he isn't gone, you have to wonder if that means we basically are just going to see the same thing we saw this season? is elliot going to od on adderall to combat mr. robot as he tries to fight not only tyrell and the progress of stage 2, but also the dark army? leading to the question, how does this benefit the dark army? granted, destroying the paper trail covers whiterose's alter ego, but it isn't the property is some warehouse. it is a nuclear power plant. overall though, it is strange when a season finale feels like the episode before one. for while it is nice we have some idea where season 3 is going to go, i honestly don't feel all that excited for it.things to notetrenton (tanya) and mobley (frederick) are seen in a post-credits scene and leon walks up on them asking for the time. leading you to believe whiterose has been recruiting heavily, or this is another trick from the writers.highlightsoutside of the surprises dealing with angela and leon, and maybe joanna and scott's scene, there isn't much to praise here.low pointswith mr. robot cutting the social commentary and philosophy of season 1, so came a show more about fostering distrust and splitting the focus too thin. leading to weak mysteries like if tyrell was alive, to multiple episodes wasted in the ray arc. ultimately making season 2 feel like an unnecessary sequel to a rather brilliant movie.on the fencewhich isn't to say the season was outright horrible. dominique was a welcome new addition, even if the constant reminders of her loneliness went nowhere. plus whiterose, with her musings, made up for elliot's memory loss and trickery. not to forget, the whole concept of how everyone wears a mask was very appealing until it was forgotten to focus on "what is stage 2?" a good episode but not such a good season finale
 the first season of mr.robot was great and had an impressive finale. when the second season began i was afraid this show was following "hannibal"s steps and was going to turn into something boring and disappointing, fortunately i was dead wrong. after the first 3 or 4 episodes this season was turning out to be really good and a breath of fresh air. although the show is sometimes difficult to understand, even cryptic at times, it is all revealed in the end. about this season's finale, it offers some sort of closure to the tyrell wellick mystery as it shows him alive and well but it also shows the never ending struggle between elliot and his other personality(his dead father) as well as the apparent demise of the fsociety. i am not happy with what kind of personality angela turned out to have or with the tyrell saying about elliot "i love him!" or with the little clichè from elliot and angela, the childhood friends who turn out to be in love with each other. over all, season 2 was above my expectations and the season finale(i though it was going to be really packed with action) was a really good episode but the season deserved a better ending. season 2 - 8.8 season 2 finale - 9.3 will not be watching on a week-to-week basis next season
 mr. robot should have ended at s1 because s2 is a complete u-turn. the show is no longer targeted at the general viewer but viewers that have a high tolerance for the shows ridiculously slow story progression, theory enthusiasts, and viewers that love 'emotional development' (by that i mean the ever-so frequent 5 minute long stares characters like angela are seen doing).season 2 overall is not a season for the average viewer. from the get go you will notice the massive (and negative) change from s1 to s2 in terms of the exaggerated cinematography, extreme lack of story progression, and misuse of emotional development as mentioned above. you will find yourself painfully forcing your way through the first 5 episodes for the story-line to actually begin, and by the end of the season you will ask yourself -- "did i really just put myself through those painful episodes for that?".ultimately, i will not be watching this show on a week-to-week basis as i have done since season 1. with that said, i feel absolutely no excitement to watch season 3. and i will most likely stop watching it completely if they continue with this new approach.fix up. your rating is going down for a reason. good season, not a great finale
 season 2 finale of mr robot was fine but the setup of the characters were weak at times. still a good season but i am excited to head into season 3. a great starter to season 3, but...
 compared to the slow pace of its earlier season, season 3 immediately redeems itself with the fast pace first episode, 'power saver mode'. the characters have become more intense - one terrified to the point of breakdown - by the results of their actions from season 2, inherently providing a much more entertaining show which has you hooked from the beginning. my favourite scene being a brief look at underground hackers competing against each other in a part-club-part-lan-party style venue. i'd love to see more of this culture within the series.as another reviewer has already mentioned however, writer and director sam esmail has decided to throw an immense amount of unnecessary political bias into this episode, by associating the collapse of the entire world economy with donald/ivanka trump, fox news, and other conservatives, who - along with elliot - have inherently kickstarted the entire downfall of human civilisation. these types of references are ridiculous at best, and destroy what is essentially a good show. the writers would be better off sticking to what is essentially a fictional story and not adding in propaganda for the sake of pleasing their hollywood-bubble buddies. was good, until it was trump-derangement-syndromed
 when a fictional show based in a fictional universe i'm wholly immersed in makes me pause it to google what the frack is going on with political digs hammered in like a shoehorn being jack-hammered into the space between two atoms it becomes awful.likening trump's entirely legal and methodical election victory to the results of complete society-breakdown is so far out there that the only conclusion is that sam ishmael suffers from complete tds. a solid character-based middle episode.
 this episode has none of the in-your-face stylish quality or deliberate sense of perplexing mystery that i love so much about this show, and it was far from my favourite episode as a result. however, i can't deny that this episode was necessary and that it probably couldn't have been executed any better. it's 45 minutes of fleshing out characters, relationships, and plots; shuffling pieces along the board without incident. not exciting, but presumably vital to later events in the season.although several characters get significantly developed in this episode, the most interesting (and the one with the most screen time) is darlene. she shows her dark side to a random woman on the train, mends her relationship with elliot, and laments her situation over drinks with dom. i already thought she was in a very interesting position between story lines at the start of this season, and this episode made things even more interesting, showing her and her motivations from multiple angles.the primary source of tension in this episode arises from the cat-and-mouse game between elliot, mr. robot, darlene, angela, dom, and tyrell. they each have their own agenda and it's fascinating to watch them weave around each other trying to achieve it, putting themselves or each other at risk and interacting in new and unexpected ways. these manoeuvres ultimately don't lead to anything particularly significant in this episode, but i'm sure they'll result in some major stuff down the line. for now, it's entertaining enough just to watch them do it.on the whole, i didn't mind this episode. it just didn't get me very excited, either. i enjoyed it fine for what it was, but i hope the coming episodes pick up the pace and bring back the stylishness. boring, predictable, the series is going no where
 really, people are on edge over this? gee, they didn't kill elliot darlene or the fbi chick. shocker!! i was hoping they might, then this series might not be so predictable and boring. what was interesting has turned into boredom. what made game of thrones entertaining is that they killed off main characters. this series is so mainstream predictable, does anyone even think they'd kill darlene? i want them to!! please, kill darlene!!!oh hey, elliot has another computer hack....zzzzzzzzzzzz. he's the smartest hack around.....zzzzzzzzzz.it just keeps dragging on. he has control of the dark army...and does nothing with it. if you're seriously entertained by where this series has gone, i suggest watching any sitcom. not the usual
 what happened to the season 1 twists? that was a great season but this is so predictable and stupid.
wtf was that when leon killed the chinese? what is the point of his character? didn't he used to serve them?to be honest the start of the season was so good and getting better and better until e8 or 9, i completely lost my interest in the series.i really hope season 4 would surprise me like season 1 average
 beside the fact that it's finally rose's background. it's just another good episode of the show but nothing special. season 3 was a lot more interesting. brilliant cinematography, some humour but overall no real plot progression
 positives:
1-fantastic cinematography
2-the woman who was trying to give them directions was really funnynegatives:
1-no real plot progression
2-some of it just felt like filler, did not learn anything we did not already know (for example about dom).this wasn't a horrible episode by any means, it was ok & i can understand why some people really liked it, but it just wasn't my type of my episode. the first three episodes were far superior in my opinion. filler episode in the final season
 this episode didn't really advance the plot that much there was a lot of wasted run time between darlene and the drunk santa and elliot and tyrell. the only truly important thing is tyrell being shot at the end of the episode and seeing something that i guess we will see next episode or two. waste of valuable time!
 what is the value added of darlene's story in this episode? and also this cheap drama between elliot and tyrell just to lead us to the moment of tyrell being shot! it was a cheap try to create an emotional moment between them disappointed
 several series i watch had an off week this week, including mr. robot. this season is the climax of the series, so i'm surprised they had enough time to create an episode that accomplishes so little -- on the surface, anyway. i'll watch the episode again to see if i overlooked something deeper.unimportant detail: why the change in episode naming this season? mac quayle used the same style for the cuts on his soundtrack for the season. somehow, the show producers didn't join in. impressive cinematography glossing over a weak plot
 a number of really eye-pleasing scenes, particularly those shots of the foggy forest glistening under the moonlight. but apart from that and a couple of humorous twists, i found myself bored and tempted to fast forward.things were made worse by the petulant millennial behavior some of the main characters (darlene, tyrell) have evolved to represent. i'd tolerate some over-dramatic complaining if the plot was strong enough to keep me hooked, but in such a filler episode it was just unbearable, at least for me. stupid ending.
 never in life would elliot go after _krista in the end. he knew he would be caught and kidnapped. he had much more urgents things to do. not acceptable is a fitting title
 i feel the writers dropped the ball in a specific manner in this episode. the use of krista as the pawn in a cooked up scheme by fernando vera to get to elliot was an illogical plot twist at face value.when a sweaty looking fernando vera, played by elliot villar, recounts a long winded parable of a "a bully and a lil bitch", a bound and gagged krista squirms and moans in terror. i immediately wonder why gloria reuben the actor has been reduced to this bs. the torture in this scene is conveyed mostly through language. sam esmail and his writing staff (amelia gray) must think they created an "edgy" script with vera's akward use of the n word for "dramatic" emphasis without any contextual reason provided for its use. entitled tone deafness on behalf of the writers while crafting these scenes was most likely at a fever pitch.the whole story line of vera and krista was full of double entendre. the image of 3 people of african descent (krista and vera's 2 loyal henchmen) in a room being fed the moral of the story, "...that is how you own a (insert racial slur)". so this elaborate return of vera seems mad suspect. is this monologue for krista, continuing the momentum from the last episode or is this some not-so-crafty message to the audience. i saw it as an example of the latter. a refreshing change of pace
 for at least the last five episodes, esmail has been leaning hard on the gas; we've been rocketing through the plot with episode after episode of dark, intense, edge-of-your-seat action. now, for the first time since "404 not found", we get a slower, more character-driven episode. if this had been located anywhere else in the season, it might have been really frustrating, but coming down off the high of 409 with another 3 to go after it, the episode feels perfectly placed.other than a tiny bit of elliot near the start, this episode is focussed entirely on dom and darlene, and their relationship. we also get cameos from two ex-dark army operatives. for the most part, this is a pretty lighthearted episode, but it definitely has some heavier moments as dom and darlene unpack their baggage. the ending is both hilarious and frustrating.i find it really interesting how the two slowest episodes of this season are both road trip episodes centered around a popular gay ship in the fandom - "404 not found" with tyrelliot, and "410 gone" with domlene. if the episode hadn't been released during finals week, when i'm super busy and didn't have time to actively anticipate it, maybe i would have felt more unsatisfied. as it was, i found it to be a tasty appetizer for the fast-approaching conclusion. worst episode of the series
 there's simply no excuse for the horrrrible choice of music at the end of this episode nor for the cliche-esque running-through-the-airport scene. airport scene was not necesssary,
 the airport scene was really lame, if this wasnt the end of the series i would stop watching right way bad
 writing your way out of such a grand climax is hard. we saw this stinker come from a mile away, and here it is in all of it's smelly glory. worst episode of the series
 this episode was really bad. it was like one of those romantic comedies. filler episodes on mr. robot were supposed to be great
 here's a quick reminder from season 3 episode 8, which for me is the best filler episode on mr robot. emotional and heartbreaking, rami malek totally nailed it and the episode itself had some substance to the plot. not only that but the cinematography was on point (as always).this is a complete slowed down and almost useless fan service episode just to feed the forced relationship between darlene and dominique. no mean to sound harsh about it but i feel time is running and there's only 3 episodes left to give closure to the series. that explains the frustration and overeaction about it, because the choice of music was actually quite nice (the hall & oates song is still stucked in my head). the scenes with leon were just gold and the reappereance of irving was intriguing.there's still hope of course because after rewatching this episode made me hating it less than the first time. still so many wrong choices and so less time till the end. fingers crossed for the next one because the trailer is promising. boring
 very boring. not much else to say. could've had that episode done in 5mins didn't like the latter part of the episode
 the part about the parallel universe makes robbing the deus group and the wealth redistribution events pointless. i really liked elliot's life in the parallel universe. it's the life he dreamt of, but getting there through a parallel universe is not satisfying. an ending in the real world would make more sense and it'll be a perfect ending to the show. a little worried
 i really dont like this "sci-fi" turn of the story in this episode. i really hope this is somehow in elliots mind (which is a strong possibility) according to the story so far. i mean the whole parallel worlds theory makes elliots struggle so far, a bit pointless. if thats the case ,whiteroses machine worked ,so the congo project cancelation was a bit pointless too. mr robot so far had logical and humble explanations to give about the acts of the protagonists .from child abuse to multiple personalities disorder all makes common sense, but this goes beyond the reasoning so far. i really want elliots struggle to end with his innermost effort and not with some ex machina trick from a plot we all missed from the beginning. i really hope this is a trick whiterose pulled like in angelas case and sam wants to make us believe in it like angela did ,because otherwise it is a bit ruined for me . the absolute lowest point
 overall the 4th season was clearly conceived to be able to bring mr robot to its end. this episode clearly marks an all time low. writers being lost. we've seen so much alternate story lines since star trek tos that it shows writers cramping for storyline. mr robot should've ended mid season 3. i pity the smashing cast that show a clear loss with this episode as well. disappointed in no hidden eggs
 elliot's parents house number is 229, it would have been better if it was 232 like rs-232his parents car license plate could have been something creative, like tcp- udp
