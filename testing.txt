 wow
 what a brilliant hour of television. i just finished watching it so i am at a loss for words but i can't wait for the rest of the season. perfect episode
 hit all the right beats for me. fantastic start to the final season! wow a+ episode
 after the first couple of minutes when angela got popped i kept thinking this is crazy how can you justify her basically dying during the opening credits. by the end of the amazing hour i didn't even care because i knew the season was going to be amazing. promising start for the season.
 mr. robot is my favourite show for multiple reasons.every single thing i like about the show's overall quality is present in this episode, and it looks like we'll be getting the final season we -and the show -and elliot -- deserve.season four proves that every single season of mr. robot is unique both visually and narratively, and this final season is, again, very well shot and acted.the gutpunch at the start was amazingly mixed with the recap of the episode. it was very fitting with the characterwork, and shows that the writers really know how to dispose of a character in a way that affects and impacts the show, and also when to dispose of a character. if this happened in shutdown -r, it wouldn't have been fitting. this was very fitting.everything in the middle is great too, but for me the best thing about the show is in the end. it was really surprising, and i can't wait for the end of the season to see it pay off.thanks sam! you're amazing. a great beginning!!
 what an episode !.
it was great, great acting great story and loved the finish of it. revenge setup deluxe.
 incredible display of revenge mood, with all kind of variations by the different characters (and their escape mechanisms).
and how desperate and helpless they all are makes it so much more intense. simply bravo! good start to the season
 this episode is the perfect season premiere episode: sets up the rest of the season. it felt a little boring about halfway through but picks back up a switch in style
 there's no doubt that 'mr. robot' is one of the greatest televisions shows to air this century. the writing is smart and quirky, the acting is brilliant, and the music and cinematography just top everything off. all of this comes to a head in the third season of the show, which is, in my opinion, essentially faultless. the first season of the show struggles to create it's own identity away from that of 'fight club', a film which massively influences the show. the second season was brilliant also, however the story span it's wheels a little too often without moving forward. esmail and co. address both of these problems in season 3, with it's brisk pace and storytelling cementing it as nothing like anything that's been seen on television before. and now we go on to season 4. is it better? i guess we'll find out. the majority of the reception to this season has been overwhelmingly positive, even more so than season 3. that being said, the one criticism that i have been hearing in regards to season 4 is to do with something that hasn't really been an issue in previous seasons. the writing. people have criticised this season for feeling rushed and all but a little too convenient.time to dive deeper into this. it's no secret that esmail has stated in the past that the show was meant to run for 5 seasons, rather than 4. therefore it is odd that he cut a possible 7 episodes worth of planned material to make one 13-episode season, rather than two 10 episode seasons. what caused this? did usa state that they only wanted the show to run for one more year? or is it because the exit of one of the show's main actors, portia doubleday, derailed the story which was already planned. maybe what we're seeing in the fourth season is a condensed version of what we were supposed to see, hence the abrupt killing offs of major characters like angela, and later tyrell and vera. though not confirmed, it is very possible that a breakup between malek and doubleday may have been at the centre of portia's exit from the show. this season switches it up in both style and personnel. the writing team, for example. writers randolph leon and adam penn, both of whom were a part of the writing team for two seasons, have no role to play in mr. robot's fourth season, while newcomers amelia gray, ted kupper and robbie pickering join the writing room. in fact it is only esmail who remains a part of the writing team alongside the newcomers, with kyle bradstreet the producer helping write only three episodes and courtney looney only returning to help write one. are the exits of leon and penn to blame for some of this season's weaker writing, especially compared to previous years. that's not to say this season doesn't have strong writing or excitement. in fact, season 4 is probably the most action-packed, intense, cinematic season yet. it even has the show's greatest episode. but there are a few moments, just a few, that make you raise an eyebrow and go 'that's weird' or 'that's convenient'. take angela's death for example.the scene carries on directly from season 3's finale- 'she was gonna bring my mom back'. it is revealed that it was whiterose who instructed phillip price to bring angela to his private home, where he would try to convince her to not do anything so that whiterose wouldn't execute her. of course, angela explains to price that she's going to try and take down whiterose, and she's executed as price slowly walks away, ripping away his wire as he does, and need for revenge against whiterose is born. this scene is excellently filmed, and on the surface-level, feels shocking and powerful. however i think it is clear that this was never the plan. doubleday wanted out, and the writers and esmail had to make do. if all price wanted to do was to keep his daughter alive, then all he had to was keep angela locked away in the safety of her room while she was still under the delusion that whiterose was going to bring her mother back. but instead, he takes her down into the garden and talks about how fake whiterose's plan is, and how angela has 'been conned', therefore it's no wonder angela is vengeful. the writing is weak here, no doubt. the writers do their best here though, but i think doubleday must've wanted out as soon as possible, or possibly it was a stylistic choice. angela's death does drive the whole season, therefore why not open up the season with it? it's a shocking opening that would really drag people back into the show, and not very many shows that are on right now open up a new season with the death of a main character. i've heard the argument that angela's death only aids the story rather than diminishes it, however, thinking back to the end of season 3, the characters were already on this path. take elliot's line 'and now i'm gonna take them down', or angela asking price 'what he was going to do to her'. elliot and phillip price already had good enough reason to go after whiterose, angela's death just adds a bit of fuel to the fire. anyway, let's talk a bit about the first episode.the decision to focus this season around christmas-time is interesting. the whole show takes place in one year- 2015, therefore ending the last season being in the christmas makes a lot of sense. the camerawork is also very different to previous seasons. where earlier seasons had the characters off to one side of the screen, and focusing in and out of them, this season has a lot of zooming, handheld camera movements, most obviously so in the final scene of the episode. the change of style is a little jarring, but also unique, and helps set this season apart from the others somewhat. everything about this season just feels so cinematic and beautiful. my main criticism of this episode outside angela's death is that every now and then the dialogue felt a tad bit to cheesy, but i'm nitpicking really (whiterose- 'i hope you enjoy your last christmas, mr. alderson'). also it seems odd that whiterose immediately has a new assistant. i guess it implies that angela's death takes place sometime after the whole barn fiasco that we saw in the season 3 finale. that being said, this beat about whiterose's assistant being sceptical of elliot felt a little bit....repetitive. this girl is the female grant. everything past the cold-open however is pretty much perfect. the excitement in the grand-central station scene was great, as was the twist that elliot had fallen into a honeypot. a real-life one. mr. robot talking to the audience is brilliant story-telling, and another nice way of switching things up for the season. darlene's descent into drugs was sad to watch, and her scene with elliot was twisted af. i also like all the irony involved in tyrell being labelled a 'hero', and his newfound boredom at the job he always wanted. one of my favourite parts from the episode was dom discovering that janice the taxidermist wasn't just janice the taxidermist, but in-fact dark army. this was a generally fantastic season premiere, minus the writing issues, that sets up the season very well.favourite moment: it's a toss-up between mr. robot talking to the audience, janice and dom and elliot and darlene. i think elliot and darlene shared the best scene of the episode. carly chaikin and rami malek have great chemistry.least favourite moment: angela's death scene is without a doubt incredibly well-done despite the issues with the writing. i would have to say that whiterose's line-'i hope you enjoy your last christmas mr. alderson' was too cheesy for me to handle. my mind is blown
 another episode, another insane twist that leaves you speechless. this is one that i personally did not see coming at all and has me asking so many questions! just another incredible episode of what i consider to be hands down the best show on television right now. 10/10! "the other one"
 this gave me chills, like this twisted, disturbing and maybe most original series always does. this was slow paced episode, full of conversation, dynamic between elliot and darlene. i wan't somehow erase next week of my life, i really can't wait what happens next: altough i tell you this: no one is'nt safe.
99.9% is'nt enough 😨 epic television
 this is epic tv. incredible storytelling. amazing direction, acting, soundtrack and everything. nothing touches it. everyone should be watching this groundbreaking series. magnifique
 that intro explaining the origins of zhang was a pure masterpiece; got me scared of my phone and my laptop! masterpiece #34 out of 45
 another awesome episode that carries the despairing tone, but combines emotional and awesome scenes to possibly hint at a somewhat happy ending for the protagonists. darlene and elliot spend a lot of time together, which i was glad to see because i love their sibling dynamic, and they have some pretty cool moments in this episode that reminded me why i like them so much as sister and brother. also the beginning and end kinda blew my mind. i'll deeply miss this show. brother & sister come together.
 enjoyed the development between elliot & darlene in this episode. brings these psychopathic characters down a bit without being to over the top. i believe this is a calm before the storm as we see elliot's quest on taking down whiterose and after the beginning we get to see a potential downfall. one of my favorite scenes with dominique's character. the sense of paranoia is starting to escalate with this character. the ending is an interesting viewing and leaves you ready for more. we could be heading to one of the best endings in television history
 this episode was trippy, emotional and funny in the most perfect way. this paired with a jaw-dropping ending makes me incredibly hopeful for the finale of this show. excellent! 9.4 out of 10 this show keeps blowing up my mind
 bring me 1. only one in the whole world that thought eliot has a 3rd personality and maybe even more.
and also a lot of questions were answered in this episode, in conclusion that means were waiting a great finale season !! slow and methodical
 this episode had a great scene with price and elliot where more info on zhang is revealed, dom's dark army contact is getting more evil by the minute, and we get great emotional stuff with elliot and darlene when their mom dies.but the ending left me speechless. i have no idea how this can be possible, but i'm praying it makes sense. another great episode
 this installment of mr. robot seems rather unimportant in the grand scheme of things but is setting things up for the future while building on character relationships confusing
 amazing episode! although the episode was a bit more slow than the last one the writing still somehow made me feel some type of tension between each conversation. it started with price in the beginning of the episode, with dom during the interview scene, and almost every word of dialogue between elliot and darlene. this is zoning in to being on the top 3 list of shows for me. the others are breaking bad and game of thrones. however, this is so far having a way better final season than got i'm just worried for our characters in this show now. 9.2 feels like a season 2 episode
 this episode stands in sharp contrast to the premiere; where that was exciting, fast-paced and straightforward, this episode is character-driven, slow and perplexing. it reminded me a lot of the second season's tone and style. for some this may be a bad thing, but i enjoyed the second season very much, and i'm happy that this season's high stakes and seven-day timespan won't stop it from having quieter episodes like this one. that being said, the transition from the premiere to this one undeniably gave me a strong feeling of whiplash.aside from the beginning, which is a somewhat cool, somewhat clunky exposition dump, and the ending, which mysteriously hints at a massive twist, the episode focusses on the grieving process, largely filtered through the lens of elliot and darlene's relationship. the premiere seemed to drive a wedge between the two of them, so i was glad this episode gave us something closer in line with their relationship of seasons past.ultimately, this episode did not satiate my craving for more mr. robot in quite the same way the premiere did, but i believe it will stand as a very strong part of the whole once all is said and done. did this episode confirm the time travel theory?
 this was an interesting one to put it mildly. the opening was cool although i'm not sure how i feel about the whole deus thing, seems a little too much. the scenes with dom and janice were excellently tense. darlene and elliot spent a lot of time together which i appreciate as i feel like they never get to share screen time anymore. the ending of this episode was extremely confusing as we see a young child we've never seen before and elliot's now dead mother. and who is the other one? something tells me that all these references to back to the future and going back to fix past mistakes as well as white rose's mysterious machine are all building to the eventual reveal of a time travel plot. if this is the case i'm not sure how they are going to pull it off but i'm willing to see them try. i'm gonna give this episode an 8.8 as i'm not really sure what's going on but am intrigued to say the least. is that elliot as a kid ?
 if thats elliot, why is he in front of a modern city ?
is her mom involve in mental control and working for witherose ?
mmm... that whiterose is one of the greatest villain ever.
always thought the biggest inspiration for sam esmail in mr robot was fight club and matrix, so we can expect for a hell of an ending. fantastic tension and surprising emotional resonance.
 there are so many pieces in play this season that it would be easy for it to become messy structurally and to lose track of the characters in all the shuffle - but it doesn't. sam esmail is an absolute genius at juggling it all, and it's particularly impressive in this episode. not only do we have all of our main characters each acting individually (sometimes incongruously) to resist the dark army, but on top of it all vera is back in town, which throws another wrench into things.there's a palpable sense of tension hanging over this whole episode; you feel like a shot is coming, but you don't know where it's gonna come from or who it's gonna hit. and yet, as i said, the episode never loses track of the characters, delivering some of the most powerful emotional moments in the series, including a backstory for whiterose and an out-of-nowhere incredible monologue from a new character introduced in this episode.this season has been on a hot streak so far, and this episode does not let it down. i feel like it has the potential to surpass season 3, which is not something i expected going in. i'm already eagerly awaiting next week. history of tv: it doesn't get any better than this.
 episode by episode, this series proves that tv can still be original, surprising and captivating:
opening suicide scene was amazing: shocking scene with beautiful way to direct full of details and very original atmosphere.
every moment and character in it was mesmerizing: it just gives me chills after chills: after this most of tv shows just doesn't feel nothing compared to this: this is highlight of my week. roses are red, roses are white...
 what an episode. it has emotional resonance, action, pay off, the whole shebang. speaking of bangs elliot and olivia am i right?! jokes aside i found that little digression very welcome and touching, reminded me of me and my exploit ;) the whole intro with white rose was beautiful, heartbreaking, tense and had one hell of a pay off. vera is back and being very much himself which makes what otherwise felt like an inconsequential plot point from season 1 have a lot more weight and importance to the overall narrative of the show. not much else i can really say. pretty stellar hour of television. 9.4/10 from me. the best show on t.v.
 this episode is far from average! it's setting up the foundation of what's to come! i'm looking forward to the next episode! a fantastic look into major characters
 '403 forbidden' is by far and away the strongest episode of season 4 so far on my re-watch. i thought it was good the first time i saw it, but not much else. however having seen the entire show i feel much differently in regards to seeing how this episode treats major characters such as whiterose and elliot.we finally get a look inside the past of the infamous whiterose, and i think this flashback has much more significance than we give it credit for. it's clear that whiterose has never gotten over the death of her lover, as we see little moments and lines during that scene have astronomical relevance during the show's present day. she is incredibly similar to angela in that aspect, who herself could never get over her mother's death, and this might come to explain how whiterose manipulated angela and others so easily. first off there's whiterose's watch, first the watch of her former lover, who was obsessed with deadlines, appointments etc. whiterose's obsession with time therefore is just one way of keeping her ex-lover alive. then there's the final line of chen- 'this world will never be good enough for us'. is there a possibility that whiterose deluded herself with this 'project' of hers because she promised chen that she would make the world better for them? it's clear that this has fuelled whiterose to hate the modern world, a world which, in certain places, doesn't allow people to be who they really are. just like elliot, whiterose hates the world, and society. however, she wants to make a new world, while elliot wants to save it. finally, we see most clearly that whiterose has never gotten over chen's suicide through the 'patience' line, showing that she is always thinking back to this moment, and that it is the basis for which everything she does. a major weakness of hers, as we'll come to see later on.meanwhile, we get the return of some major characters. notably vera, who's returning scene is pretty funny and well played-out. elliot and krista also share a great scene this episode. speaking of elliot, his character is explored a little bit more in this episode, more than i remember it being.his scenes with olivia are amazing, on the same level as the opening flashback. firstly the awkwardness at the bar, which was strangely hilarious, and then him connecting with olivia later on. it's pretty heartbreaking knowing what happens later though. at least he was able to gain some happiness for a short time before it all goes down the drain.favourite moment: a real toss-up this. elliot and olivia share probably the best scene of the episode, although the death of whiterose's lover is such a brilliant bit of writing.least favourite moment: nah. none. symbolism, tension, and emotion. one of my favorite eps to date.
 while it is no major turning point in the story, this ep takes the time to explore familiar characters in a different way to what we've seen before.the opening scenes set up whiterose's past, and open a path to sympathize with her more than before. the symbolism here is on point.while the episode shows us eliott as more angry focused than ever, it also contrasts this beautifully with him opening up almost by mistake in one of the better romance scenes on television.great stuff intense emotional resonance
 we finally get our first ever flashback scenes for whiterose and it's superb. this episode has so much amazing emotional development that was so important to the characters, especially elliot and whiterose. this flashback humanizes whiterose much more than i expected was possible and elliot's hack of olivia brings him one step closer to facing his feelings. hopefully he doesn't take any more steps back this time. also elliot villar is in the main cast now, which is super cool. great depth to great characters
 this episode makes me care for characters i didn't think i could. it picks up the pace and drops a bombshell. setting stuff up and the pay off will be great juices are currently flowing
 vera!! had to get my excitement out of the way. as always, this episode explores the depth of the characters, most notably whiterose. we begin to see deeper into her character and gain somewhat of an explanation for her immoral decisions. elliot finally gets a win, but by now we know those come with a price in this show. either way, his path in this episode was awesome and a little sad (especially considering angela), and it showed a side of elliot the audience had never really seen before. olivia looks like lady gaga and i love rami malik
 a strange episode like this needs a strange review like mine. loved the background story of white roz. it shows us the pain she went through and i cant wait to find out what her project is. beautiful character-driven episode
 this episode was very unexpected for me. it was funny and surprising, but also touching and deeply beautiful. it showed us some very important emotional aspects of eliott, darlene and tyrell. the slow pace resembled me some of those breaking bad episodes in which the main plot doesn't develop much, but we get to know the characters and their relations with a lot more depth. i love it. mr robot's pine barrens
 i don't know what i was expecting this week, but it wasn't this... this, was one of the funniest, saddest, most surreal episodes of the show to date. the first half made me full on belly laugh, a couple of times actually. the second half almost brought me to tears. the cinematography was absolutely beautiful and the score this time round is particularly enchanting.
it's difficult to explain what makes this episode so great, but it is just that. great. literally cried
 tyrell standing on the dark night road and the moon behind him wow!!! i literally cried when he walked on the dark road the bottle episode we deserve
 comedic relief is like a secret weapon this show keeps in its back pocket to be used for unique episodes like this, and the main characters' deadpan reactions to the strange and obnoxious people around them never fail to make me laugh. even though this is a drama, so were breaking bad and the sopranos, both of which had some hilarious moments. apart from the humor, this is the bottle episode i've been waiting for. i don't think there's been an episode this bizarre in mr. robot since elliot's morphine withdrawal episode in season 1, and both of them stand out to me as bottle episodes because their plots focus on very specific problems for the characters. whereas before it was elliot's addiction, now it's a hunt for a dark army spy, with some juicy plot and character development for dom, darlene, and tyrell sprinkled in. abed from community described bottle episodes as "wall-to-wall facial expressions and emotional nuance", which has somewhat of a lazy connotation, but this show chooses to tell a gripping story even in its bottle episodes. that's why it's not just a tv show, it's a masterpiece. how are they doing this? i don't know
 since the very beginning of season 3, i have seen a great change to this series. the episodes are more focused on the 50-60 mins rather than the entire story. but they are building the story at the same time. i have to say this, it's not just an episode anymore, it's art.almost all the episodes since season 3 has been amazing. this one also adds the essence of art that they are constantly producing. i love how by the time of winter, they are focusing on the individual characters and their actual self. they are kinda reflecting upon themselves. and you can't blame them, it's that time of the year.
i have nothing but respect for sam. also for rami.
i hope this artwork is continued throughout the whole show. a very strange episode indeed
 most of this episode feels like a road-trip buddy comedy, then towards the end it gets very melancholy and meditative, and then the final scene is just bizarre. i'm really not sure what to make of it. it's a pretty slow episode overall, but it's gorgeous to look at and has some fantastic character development.in some ways the episode is very reminiscent of "pine barrens" from the sopranos; the plots are quite similar and they both derail the main narrative for a grumpy buddy-adventure in the woods. however, where "pine barrens" is very much a comedic episode, "404 not found" is much more serious and introspective. while there's definitely a lot of comedy here, most of it arises almost unintentionally from the characters; we laugh, but then feel guilty and wonder if we were supposed to.all in all, this is not one of my favourite episodes of mr. robot, but it's one that i'll remember; it's very different from the rest and it has an absolutely gorgeous aesthetic. i mean, sam esmail always directs the hell out of this show, but this one is particularly pretty. mesmerizing and beautifully crafted episode!
 that final scene got me really thinking... what the heck was that? yet another flawless episode! slow-paced yet very entertaining nonetheless. so when wellick is in his last moments and he walks towards that mysterious sound that is heard during the entire episode - when the trio, elliot, wellick and mr robot, are stranded - it really does resonate well with the melancholic departure of wellick being a mysterious character himself in this show. it was a fitting end for the character! an emotional high
 the moment this episode ended i had very mixed feelings about it. i just knew i had to watch it again before i reviewed it and i'm glad i did. once that anxious feeling i get in my chest when i hope something with the main story is happening goes away and i just focus on the episode, i love this episode. it's got the funniest moments of the season so far, mr. robot screaming at that woman when he's ran out of patience, the drunk santa calling darlene "dolly", etcetera. but this episode also was deeply introspective and did the characters of dom, darlene, and particularly tyrell, so much justice when it comes to their emotional journeys.when i see this episode's ending without it instantly cutting to commercial and ruining the experience, i feel the sense that this is how tyrell's journey is meant to end. he was never "one of them" (the 1%), so why would his journey end in some big explosive moment that we're anticipating it to for a character like whiterose near the end of the season? tyrell was always the most mysterious character of mr. robot and he gets the most mysterious, but also strangely the most beautiful, death on the entire show, especially for a character of his importance.i loved seeing darlene work through her feelings with tobias. i empathize so much with her attempt to help tobias after taking all of the dark stuff he said on the car ride the wrong way. it makes total sense why she would take it the wrong way, not just because of her emotional state in this episode, but also because of her job as a sibling to elliot. darlene is always worried about him and that part of her comes out when tobias says all these things. it's perfect for her character and i also like the twist that the drunk santa character is actually a super nice guy, which i wasn't expecting on my first watch.dom's storyline calls back to when she showed up at angela's place unannounced and told her about her nightmares she has where she's drowning, and that the moment she gives up control and stops fighting, she wakes up. we actually get to see this dream play out on screen, except it's mixed with her sexual feelings that come with being a lonely person and her fear of the dark army being everywhere because they are everywhere.all of these storylines don't matter in the grand scheme of things, probably (except for tyrell dying, that'll be important). and once you let go of that need for answers, you get one of the best single episodes of mr. robot for its characters. and it doesn't get much better than that.and also the directing and cinematography is gorgeous.and also pine barrens. peak of mr. robot
 this season deserves many awards, easily the best episode of this season till 4th cinematographical masterpiece
 as from the beginning of season 4, excellent cinematography and the background score is gripping and prompt. i think this is an art in a way which every episode is crafted.
and i dont know why people saying this was a boring filler unrequired episode.... i think not at all. it was about the feel of being present in the woods cold and stark, the atomosphere they created and the suspense towards the end and throughout scary christmas vibes. i would regeret if i wouldn't had seen this episode., plains trains and automobiles
 a brilliant episode that manages yet again to change your stereotypical views. superbly written, acted, directed and produced. they're listening... and so was i to a piece of true art.
 i have got to be honest, i did not expect the episode to turn out like this, but boy i am very happy it did! this episode of mr robot was a pure form of art, it kept me utterly engaged through its suspenseful scenes and mesmerising score. so powerful that i did have goosebumps during this episode! episode 404 does not follow the usual suit of a mr robot episode, to put it simply, it was something i never knew i needed so much until it was presented to me. that is one of the best feelings a show could give you. after seeing elliot's more sensitive side in the previous episode, that showed us a long awaited romantic side of elliot that we had not seen for a while; i am happy to see elliot once again showing that he is indeed human. not the "robot" that he may portray at times, this was shown when getting tyrell back on board after losing all hope, this is so elliot could warn his sister darlene of what is to possibly come. it again shows that elliot does care at the right time of course, even if darlene does not see it often. then, we are shown a magnificent piece of visual art, elliot face to face with tyrell with the camera and lighting almost making them seem shadowlike. it reminds us as fans of all they went through with each other that most do not know about. they really have been through a war together to achieve something that is bigger than both of them. a scene that got me in the feels was at the end, which could be their final scene onscreen. this is tyrell telling elliot to "make sure" he takes "care of whiterose". elliot responds saying he tyrell die, with tyrell saying he's "just going for a walk". i felt that, a very moving scene to say the least with the soundtrack making it more emotional. it was a good transition to how they depicted tyrell wellick's "death", or his last moments before that. this was with his slow hobble wandering into the woods upon seeing a bright alluring light, but what was it... then the show closes whilst fading to white to mournful background music, truly powerful once again, it triggers an array of emotions, and could indicate tyrell's death... but, is tyrell really dead?, i do hope not and darlene somehow stumbles upon him. or they bring him back from the dead (again!) a few episodes later. ultimately, if tyrell really is dead, philip price may be forced to remain as ceo of e corp, thus elliot losing his insider at e corp. it seems to be working in whiterose's favour, but could elliot use this chaos to his advantage? i predict this show will be my show of the year once again, just as season 3 was. it's sad that this is the final season, but i am impressed at the direction the show is heading. thrilling
 one of my favorites so far. darlene struggling to find elliot while enjoying a deep and funny conversation with drunk santa, finally having the chance to unburden her feelings. on the other side, elliot has to play tyrell's therapist, when they just spend their time walking in circles. sure, it had to end by rising our curiosity about the howling mysterious blue light.
photography was beautiful and the soundtrack matched the episode perfectly. doesn't matter if it's a filler episode
 some people are calling this a filler episode, and it essentially is. the plot doesn't really change much throughout this episode, but why does that matter? if the episode is still enjoyable and engaging, then why is it important for there to be big advancements in terms of the plot? this episode was easily the funniest in season 4 so far, but more than that, the atmosphere and side stories with darlene and dom were fantastic. it showed a more caring and vulnerable side of darlene, as she was helping this random stranger, that we don't often see. and having tyrell and elliot/mr. robot spend the entire episode together on the run/lost in the woods was very refreshing after tyrell's absence from the show. also the atmosphere of the woods, along with the random noises being heard throughout, was pretty creepy and gave the show kind of a horror feel, instead of a thriller, for the first time. and it technically did advance the plot, because whatever those noises were coming from, and that tyrell found at the end, i can only assume is something pretty wild and possibly pretty important, and i'm stoked to find out what it is and it's relation to the story. mr. robot!! the show where even a filler episode is deep and melancholic!
 only a show like mr. robot can produce a filler episode where literally nothing substantial happens and yet somehow be incredibly deep and charged with a sense of nostalgy and melancholy that rivals the best episode some lesser shows offer. things pick up
 this episode is very interesting and is where this season starts to pick up, however tyrells death feels, incomplete and it's disappointing and it doesn't feel like it will ever be complete just amazing
 it's just one of the best episodes in the show with a great cinematography music and a unique atmosphere it really reveals how complex and different the characters are and how tyreel and elliot see death from a different perspective and we dived deeper in the relation between elliot and tyrell and elliot with darlenne . in general its a very beautiful episode visually dramatically in wich you will experience fear suspense and even humor and finally i've got to say that the death of tyrell in the end was one of the most emotional and beautiful end of caractères in tv shows . triumph
 a triumph. it is one of the best 48 minutes of tv i have seen. wow!
 i think this episode deserves much more than 8,9 rating, at least 9,3. despite there isn't much plot in this, it's incredible. mr robot has crazy direction, maybe even better than breaking bad. this episode reminds of "pine barrens" from sopranos but in a darker mood. funny enough that a few days ago i watched better call saul "pine barrens" episode. is almost perfect
 i cried for welick, but it is not very clear what happens to him, which is not necessarily bad, just that i expected another ending for this great character. one of the greatest episodes of television this decade, and perhaps ever.
 this is the best episode of mr. robot yet, and up there with breaking bad with levels of creativity and suspense. the fact that there were two lines in the episode but still managing to keep your attention and waiting for every second during a commercial break to see what's going to happen next. absolutely genius episode from sam esmail and i just don't understand how he was able to do it with what seems like immense simplicity. one of the greatest episodes of television this decade, and in my opinion, of all time. sam esmail is a genius.
 405 is among the greatest episodes of television ever created. darlene with the "it's cool dude. we don't have to talk" at the beginning. then the episode progresses without any character ever talking to each other. the choice of music at every moment is brilliant. the direction and cinematography, the smooth transitions between different story lines, the acting - it is all mind blowing. and the final "it's time we talked" at the end is just unbelievable. i created an account solely to review this episode - that is how good it is. sam esmail, take a bow. you're an absolute genius. a near-silent, edge-of-your-seat heist thriller
 this episode is very reminiscent of season three's "eps3.4_runtime-err0r.r00". both episodes take a ground-level, tension-heavy focus on a hack that needs to get done in a very short window of time, and both episodes are structured around an impressive stylistic gimmick. where the former episode tells its entire story in one continuous shot, this episode is almost entirely without dialogue. once you pick up on what the episode is doing, it's fun to catch all the clever ways the writers work maintain the silence.yet as fun as it is to watch the episode, with all of its stylistic flourishes, the filmmaking never undercuts the tension. quite the opposite, really. aside from a couple brief scenes focussing on side characters, the action is sufficiently fast-paced and intense that idle chit-chat would just break things up unnaturally. instead, you get a 49-minute unrelenting edge-of-your-seat experience. there were points in the episode where i was getting faint because i wasn't breathing enough.this is a stellar episode of mr. robot, one of the best in the show's impressive resume. where last week's episode was slow and dialogue-heavy, this one is lightning-fast and almost totally silent. masterpiece! one of the best episodes *all time*
 my brain is on error 404 rightnow
sam esmail proven himself again one of the greatest writer/directors off all time in tv alongside damon lindelof and vince gilligan & david chase i'm seriously short of words here
 just like last week i have to come here again and say that, i just want this show to keep on going like this for a long time. this was yet another brilliant adaptation of cinematography and acting and music. if you're a fan of classical music, you are really in for a treat my friend.again, while keeping the story afloat, their priority is solely on what's happening in the current episode. the suspense is unreal and i was off of my seat for a long time. hats off to the actors for their brilliant performance altogether.
i'm so glad this show is running right now and i have something amazing to watch every week. how long did it take you to realise...
 ...that - with the exception of eight words spoken in the opening seconds of the episode and, 48 minutes later, four words in the last seconds - not one word is uttered?a perfect complement to the last two episodes, which were unusually rich and introspective in character development/backstory and very talkative.this continues to be the most innovate, intelligent, and enthralling show on tv, and in four seasons this was, to date, perhaps the most edge-of-your-seat, breathtaking action/suspense roller coaster ride.i also have to add that, given the absence of dialogue, mac quayle continues to be a major player in the show with his brilliant musical contributions. i especially loved the sort of deconstruction and remix of the fourth movement of beethoven's ninth symphony. i hope he releases a sixth album of his score for the show's final season.and the cheesy christmas music adds the right touch of irony.dare i even say this: hitchcock could have learned from sam esmail!yet again, a 10 out of 10 episode! masterpiece
 everything in this episode was perfect.
only two lines of dialogues in entirety of this episode.
episode begins with "it's cool dude, we don't need to talk" and ends on "it's time we talk".
probably the best mr.robot episode till date mesmerising, breathtaking
 the whole episode was just a series of clips tied together with a masterclass story-telling. the originality has always been the talking point of mr. robot, sam esmail did it once again. two dialogues, 48 minutes of suspense one huge hack what more could an episode offer... kudos this is what makes me robot great
 straightly put, as the other reviews have stated before me, this episode is a masterpiece! to come to the realization at the end that there indeed wasnt any dialogue since the beginning is mindblowing! the whole episode was incredible stylised filming the likes of vince gilligan, and just as creative and gripping as ever! great job guys. wow
 masterclass. held my breath for fifty minutes. cinematography is stunning, i can't wait for the next episodes. this is proven to be one of the best shows ever, not a single letdown in four seasons. this is art, mr. esmail!
 only after watching it to the end did i realize that only two sentences were spoken for the whole duration of the episode.i was completely immersed.absolutely stunning and beautiful cinematography.
this is art, mr. esmail!!the hacking was well done as always, but now it was maybe pushing it too much on the *unbelievable* side, because without extensive prior recon not even elliot could pull this off. but eh, it's still the greatest show ever, arguably better than got and bb. brilliant
 it's started with 'we don't have to talk' and ended with 'it's time we talk'. sam esmail is pure genius this is how you create good tv
 i can't believe how original this episode was. my heart was on the verge of heart attack the whole time. an episode without dialogues, who would do that? amazing.
the suspense that was handled here was from another world.
everything in this episode was perfect. everything! one of the best episodes of the whole series
 the fact that the episode has one line at the beginning and another at the end makes this brilliant masterpiece a resson for the actors and the music producer to be proud of i just signed in to rate this episode 10/10
 best television series episode ever. the methods used shooting the scenes are just epic and also i felt the tension in my body, i got goosebumps because of the silence in many scenes. there's so much to talk about it but you know..(spoilers) great work sam esmail... i'm so high right now.
 thanks for everything sam ismail. great chapter, it kept me sitting close to the edge every minute. this show is consistently perfect
 elliot and darlene are officially the most entertaining brother-sister duo on television, and the fact that it's basically them against the world at this point just makes their dynamic even cooler. keep em comin', esmail, you beautiful genius-person. absolute masterpiece.
 i can't believe what i just saw. this is definitely one of the best episodes i've ever watched in tv.
it's extraordinary how sam esmail managed to pull this off without any dialogue.
again, unbelievable. i have no words
 this episode was a mesterpiece. i'm as silent now as this episode was. holy jesus
 just holy jesus i was looking at the wall for 20 minutes after this easily one of the best tv episodes ever.
 it could be viewed as a gimmick, i just thought it was effective story-telling and effective it really was. compelling from beginning to end. exciting from beginning to end. this is on top of the impeccable email service that each episode gets. seriously impressive. very cool
 my niga elliot has the cardio for a drug addict hacker among one of the greatest things in tv history!
 i was a little late to see this and still worth it. i'd say in the top 4 best episodes since release of mr. robot it's had mind blowing experiences to watch that are incredible for me and others i'd imagine! i can't wait to own season 4 on blu-ray. the perfect amount of tension and exhilarating awesomeness! still reassembling the scattered pieces of my mind after watching this.
 i am going to watch this episode again as soon as i get myself back together. after the final breaking bad episode, i suffered a while from post-walter-white-is-gone-forever depression, but then along came mr. robot, and i became interested again. i think season 4 is executing at the highest level of the series. these shows hold their own with the best of got and breaking bad. this episode in particular is a marvel, and a gift. wow
 episodes by episodes its getting more intense and thrilling. what an episode it was. direction and screenplay was breath taking and it felt like i m watching some gta mission. wow three deeply uncomfortable vignettes
 this season has been pretty trigger-happy so far, killing major characters nearly every episode, so when this one decided to focus on three separate stories of people in apartments threatening each other with violence, i got pretty worried somebody wasn't going to make it out alive. as always, esmail does a fantastic job keeping the tension at a fever pitch the whole hour. i spent the entire time guessing, and second-guessing, and still finding myself wrong.every episode this season has kept me on the edge of my seat, but this one added an extra layer to it; discomfort. the characters say some truly painful things to each other, and it's very tough to sit through. it's like watching a car crash in slow motion; you know it's inevitable. but you keep looking for ways out.my only complaint about this episode is that it ends. that's not a joke, i'm legitimately complaining. i wish i had the strength of will to wait for the whole season to be out so i could watch it at a non-maddening pace, but sam did too good a job and i get irrationally angry at him sometimes because of it. perfection as usual
 the gang's all here. what's left of them, at least. this show gives me certainty that truly excellent television will never die, because there will always be artists who refuse to change to please the network or a new demographic or whatever source of creative downfall. esmail is that artist, telling the incredible story he created, and it's not over yet. intense, emotional and thrilling!
 really good episode! i thought that there was so much different emotions in this one. 3 story lines where one is more critical than the other one! so much thriller which i enjoyed very much! an episode of confrontations
 all three plot lines contain incredibly stressful, intense confrontations. all of them were incredible, but those between darlene and dom were my favorites. i've never felt so nervous for a character in my life then when dom was ordered to kill darlene.the deus meeting is on the horizon and whiterose is saying that elliot should be shown her project so he sees that they're on the "same side". it's starting to feel like an insane reveal of some kind is happening very soon. another phenomenal episode
 i'm running out of words to describe each new episode of mr robot. each week we are getting the quality of writing and acting equivalent to damn near perfection. i'm hoping and praying this season continues to be this incredible, as i personally think mr robot can/will solidify itself as the best show in the history of television when it wraps up! 10/10 episode! elliot crossed the line
 this is what the episode should be called. one of the greatest thing about this season and unlike the whole 3 seasons before. this season elliot is the bad guy and mr.robot is the good one. how far would you go?
 without spoiling, this episode is emotional. it makes you question how far you'd go to get what you want. mr robot is on fire with these great episodes can't wait for the next one.
 i kind of hate the fact that i have to watch every episode so i don't get spoiled, but at the same time wait a week between every episode. this, especially is going to be hard for me to endure. i wonder how this all turns out.there are some really really intense moments where i just didn't know what would or could even happen. the performances are all fantastic, cinematography is still really unique and amazing, what can i even really say?although i feel like some parts of the story will be detailed enough only when we see the bigger picture. i might lower the score because of that. still, amazing filmmaking and script. insane epidode
 just like whole series and this season. every time i think this is it no show can't be any better than this epidode, it somehow manage to be more intense, edgier, more thrilling, and more captivating. second best show right after breaking bad. an expectedly great hour of television.
 every episode this season has been an absolute joy. from the shocking premiere, to the surreal 404 not found and last week's silent heist thriller. this episode is no different. we get an extremely tense collection of vignettes, all equally disturbing as the last. dom is ordered to kill darlene, vera interrogates krista and elliot drugs and blackmails olivia. all of these plot threads go to the darkest of places we've seen in the show and elliot's against the clock to set his plan into motion and bring down the deus group once and for all but it seems there's a vera sized cog in his machine which promises to be the focus of our conflicts next week. i'm gonna give not acceptable a 9.2. intense and powerful
 this episode doesn't contain any of the 'biggest moments' of the series, but my god it's intense, powerful and emotional. wow. great writing, great acting - just great. now we are talking
 finally i feel mr.robot's vibes again. this is the first episode that actually felt like mr.robot in this season. mixture of dark emotions ,fast paced adventure, drama, action and hacking. you name it. good, but the show is taking the slowest pace yet
 when sam announced that the show would be reduced from 5 to 4 seasons, i thought that the pacing would be highly intense, but the show dragging even when compared to the beginning of season 2. episode 1 would be whirlwind of mindfuck; episode 2 is gradual but mystery packed by magda's death; episode 3 is whiterose's backstory episode 4 is the meaningless santa story and walk in the woods, which i still save my judgement till the end; episode 5 is solely for hacking virtual realty; and episode 6 is mostly spent for the setups of the next one.we are half way through the season without any answers yet, and elliot and darlene's relationship still unthoroughly solved. the stories are there and the themes of each episode are awesome but i feel so sidetracked. this episode is not as good as people are making it out to be. first episode of the series i wasn't wowed by.
 i don't want to spoil it, but this is the first episode of the entire series that i actually was disappointed in. it all felt too convenient and the things happening felt like mistakes elliot wouldn't make and same thing with decisions darlene made. i just felt like it was drama for the sake of drama and to make things harder for elliot to get stuff done later that night (which i still believe will be a success for elliot as it's his only chance so somehow it's going to end up working out.) so yeah, i tried to say this without any spoilers.with spoilers :i felt like it was unlike darlene's / dom's character to not shoot the 3 dark army peole when they walked in and just give the gun up. then elliot getting kidnapped.... come on, the only person he would actually take a chance messing up tonight's thing is darlene. so he conveniently gets kidnapped as well. i felt liek these things happened for two reasons....one to make it harder for elliot, two to bring together elliot with either vera or leon or possibly geting them both on his side. i 100% believe elliot will succeed in next weeks episode although he will have to deal with the fallout of what happens to darlene and dom. it may not all get figured out and he made not succeed by next week's episode because so little time is going by for all the episodes. the whole season hasn't been that much time if you aren't counting angela's death. hell 2 episodes ago i'm pretty sure was just last night. so yeah, idk i just felt like this episode was average writing and made things happen just to tie things together and make it so he doesn't defeat white rose with ease. as i said in the title this is the first episode of the entire series that i don't rate at least an 8 to. i hope in the last 4 episodes things aren't much more lame and simple than they appeared the entire show. a riveting stageplay, presented in five acts
 man, what an incredible episode. this is what's known as a bottle episode; that is, an episode which uses as few characters and locations as possible. usually they're done for budgetary reasons, but sometimes a more artsy show like this one will do one for effect. the intended effect in this case is claustrophobia; we're trapped in this apartment with these characters for an hour, with no commercial breaks and no scene changes to allow us a reprieve.and yet, while the limited setting undoubtedly creates a sense of claustrophobia, it also weirdly lends a grandiosity to things. the episode feels very much like a stageplay, a feeling which is reinforced by a series of intertitles throughout the episode proclaiming the beginning of five different acts. this structure gives a strong feeling that the episode is building towards something, and it most certainly is; near the end we get one of the biggest and most devastating twists of the series.i'd be lying if i said that i went into the episode without expectations, given the way the network has been hyping it up, but it blew me away regardless. if you haven't watched it yet, avoid the internet like a plague until you have. it's a big one. give rami malek and elliot villar their emmy's right now!
 4x07 is truly a remarkable episode, featuring one of the best performances given by rami malek and elliot villar throughout mr robot's run. this episode reveals an insanely shocking plot twist that i didn't see coming, but it makes so much sense and fits so well. i don't think it's far-fetched to call this the best "bottle episode" in television history. another brilliant, riveting episode in a stellar final season! thank you sam esmail! made an account just to rate this 10/10
 absolute wonder of cinematography and storytelling five acts = five stages of grief
 1. denial
2. anger
3. bargaining
4. depression
5. acceptancevery clever sam. brilliant episode! i think i have to make some changes
 i didn't knew why i loved this show so much, i have never seen a character that resembles me so closely. i am also into cyber security and programming and have been struggling with drugs for the past years. i'm having a lot struggle to connect to people and i know this is because i was also abused for years. this episode really broke me... holy s**t
 holy s**t. best episode of the series and that's saying something because this entire run has been damn good. and the truth comes out
 vera's purpose for coming back is finally brought to light. this bombshell of a reveal has been a part of the show's core since the very beginning. the more i think about it, the more sense it makes. we would get more information on elliot's fall out the window every season, pieces to the puzzle. and we just got the core piece, the most important one: the contextual one. the real reason why he jumped out that window. it all comes full circle and this now seems like something that there will be no turning back from. elliot will never be the same, nor will his relationship with mr. robot, if he will even have one anymore after this.in short, this episode is a game-changer. a five act game changer for the show and tv in general
 this episode left me speechless. presented as a stageplay, 2 rooms, few actors, and limited camerawork, yet it one of the most impressive hours of anything i've ever seen. this crew took tv to a whole another level, i mean it. the themes here are incredibly dark, but it all feels real, this stuff happens and i'm grateful to this show to put something like this out there, and to do it masterfully. that said, this could really upset some people.
to esmail, crew and actors, you are masters of your artwork.
thank you. 2 days later, i still can't shake this episode
 i, too, created an account just to review this episode. everything was perfection - the lighting, music, sets, writing and especially the acting. it was absolutely the right decision to run the episode commercial-free, as it kept the tension going non-stop. i never cry at tv episodes. i cried at elliot's complete breakdown, how could you not? as another reviewer said, a lot of elliot's little quirks now make sense, like he doesn't like to be touched. the entire 4th act was very unnerving, and very hard to watch. in a way, i saw this huge bombshell coming as soon as vera asked an explanation for the "window", but i really didn't want to believe it. i think elliot is lashing out at mr. robot unjustly, because mr. robot was doing what elliot's mind created him for - he was protecting him - protecting him from the truth about his father. this episode forever changed the series, and i can't wait to see how sam esmail can top this! he is a true genius, and i wish this absolute gem of a series wasn't ending. if rami malik doesn't win every available award for his heartbreaking performance here, they should stop giving awards period. this is the episode that will forever define his career. elliot villar should also get an emmy nod. if you can make the freakin' villan sympathetic ... and gloria reuben gave the performance of her career here. i have no words
 i balled my eyes out harder than i ever have while watching a tv show. sam esmail is a genius. this episode is a masterpiece and will go down in history as one of the greatest works of art ever created. award season is cancelled
 just give sam esmail, gloria reuben, rami malek, christian slater and elliot villar all the awards in the world. it's 2am and i'm here in my bed, shivering, trying to process what i just witnessed.what a masterpiece, every moment reminded me why i love this show from day first and will miss it dearly in a few weeks.2019 brought up a lot of tv entertainment disappointment in many shows ending, but surely mr. robot is gradually rising in intensity, leading to its finale which i hope will be a grand conclusion to this incredible show. the best episode of television of all time
 this show continues to completely break all expectations that i had. previously, runtime error was my favorite episode and i had no idea how they were going to surpass that, but they did.this episode changes everything and is one of the most powerful, beautiful, and amazing things to ever grace television. the acting is beyond unbelievable. though the episode is nearly entirely dialogue the tension is greater than any other episode prior (even runtime error!) it's slow, sombre, dark, and quite possibly the greatest hour of television ever produced.bravo everybody can i please rate that episode 11 / 10, because that was phenomenal television
 just...:wow.....everything was......wow....i could´t breath the whole episode , the tension was just absolutly astonishing !i cant believe they topped episode 5 of this season, i thought this was the highlight of the series but this episodes just blew everything in any way away !mr. robot just became one of the greatest tv series of all time !greetings from germany (: best episode this season with thunder like reveal presenting the rebearth of elliot.
 so the episode ended, the credits followed, then the started the commercials and my mouth was still wide open ...
sam esmail wrote and directed this season and one of the strongest in while ...
mark my words .. this episode will get him and rami malek nominated again for the emmyes.the episode was structurally built over five acts,, each act ended with a loud thunderous truth until the last elliot's scream of loneliness which made him really see what made him shelter himself into the arms of mr. robot.as i said the directing was spotless,, the script was well written .. so connected that it felt i was in shakespearean theater .. the drama kept on escalating up until the last minute which again we've been hit by another unexpected scene.,. and the intense back and forth inteacting between rami malik and elliot villar was just breathtaking.lastly, we've reached mid-season now ,, 6 episodes left .. so praying for a blast of a series finale that would make me storm into 2020 with a new me :d best episode of season 4 (maybe ever?)
 some of the best writing, pacing, and acting i've ever seen on tv. it had me clutching my heart and sweating and it was just dialogue. absolutely powerful episode that will stick with me for the rest of my life. just finished watching it, i'm still shaking. mind-blowing on all levels
 the realization that the creation of mr. robot was a way for elliot to escape the horrors of being sexually abused by his father along with the circumstances that brought the truth to light are just examples of how everything can happen in life the opposite we expect it to. what an emotional roller-coaster this season has been, and to think its only half over!! this is art.
 this was one of the best if not the best episode of mr. robot. wait a second, as a matter of fact, this was maybe the best episode ever aired on television.are you not entertained? the wait for vera was worth it
 the villains of mr. robot are pure entertainment. ray is my favorite, mainly because of his awesome speeches about prophets who hear voices and falling in the dark, but vera might be the unanimous winner when the show's over. jesus christ
 jesus christ
jesus christ
jesus christ
jesus christ
jesus christ
jesus christ
jesus christ the most powerfull tv episode ever
 an emotional roller coaster, a truly amazing achievement in television history, this shows that the only thing a tv show (or any other form of art) the only thing need it is human conection.
this episode does it in an incredible, powerfull, unique way simply the best
 this is the first review i ever written. i was absolutely stunned. a masterpiece. can't even find a words to describe it. thank to everyone who took a part to create it elliot verra, christian slater, and rami malek are riveting
 so much brilliance and suspense going on all at once - i love it all! this show is so much enlightenment to me and i am shocked there's barely any commercials if at all i usually watch hbo. mr. robot is one of the greatest things going on right now! i love how immersive so much of it is. " i see you now"
 i swear this show is gonna give mean anxiety disorder. remembwr s3ep4? and then ep5? .. and now comes this masterpiece to triumph them all. the acting and the mood were top notch, the cinematography is yet to be beaten by any other show, and once again social problems were put out on the light in ways we've never seen before. mr. robot has truly established itself among the best ever. a thrilling, relating, visual and groundbreaking masterclass that needs to be seen by all! i see you now.
 some say that the best villains are the ones that actually win.
by this rule, vera is one of the best villains, because he could actually connect with elliot.i am now completely sure that this show will go down the exact road i want it to. by that, i don't mean that the story will be the way i want, but it will be as good as i want it to be.the show always proves itself. it shows that the filmmakers know what they are doing in every way it matters.sam esmail gives this episode a five act structure, like a stage-play, the five acts are presented via the mr. robot font, and it makes sense because the whole episode takes place in 2 locations, and there are only 6 actors present in the whole episode.this turning point was probably what they wanted the season 4 finale to be when the show was planned to be 5 seasons long, and structurally it makes sense and it's perfect, and i just really want to know how everything really unravels from this point on.this is an episode with excellent dialogue and direction, and brilliant performances, but what really makes it work apart from rami malek's beautiful acting and esmail behind the camera, is the fact that it feels like this was all planned from the beginning, and it... it makes sense.this is probably the best episode of this show. it's quite amazing in every way. and it gave vera a purpose, and also some poetic ending for his character. he achieved what he wanted, he connected with elliot, after he broke him. he came to his hospital, after he bashed his face in with an eastern magnum aluminum baseball bat. but krista, worried for her own, and elliot's life stabs him with the very knife that killed shayla, finishing that storyline for good. vera won in the end, he achieved his goal, but he also paid for what he did.and as elliot watches his only current friend slowly die, he's all alone again.vera allowed elliot to want someone by his side, he finally wants not to be alone. and that is where this show is going. vera was important to this show in the end, he was the one to finally allow elliot to be happy, but elliot still needs time to recover. but what about the deus group meeting? will there be enough time for elliot and darlene to do the deus group meeting, or will elliot leave whiterose alone for good? will she even get to show her true intentions?did mr. robot go away for good?we'll get answers to these questions, i'm sure about it.
but this was brilliant. i am on the verge of crying. thank you sam esmail, and everyone involved. i love all of you. you make my life easier every week. i am shaking
 this is the most intense episode i have ever watched of anything. sam is a genius and i don't know how he does it, but it's just wonderful.the performance of the actors is flawless. the emotions they transmit are magnificent in variety and quality. this episode is going to give them awards.the revelations and twists in this episode alone are just unbelievable. it's hard to coupe with the number of things going on in just one room.i am shaking. i am still in shock. what a time to be alive and what a privilege to see this show unravel. this is, without doubt, a masterpiece. they set everything up so perfectly...
 one of my favourite things about this show is the way events get recontextualized over the course of the show. after every season (hell, every episode), you can rewatch all the previous episodes and they'll take on a completely different meaning - while still making just as much (and often more) sense. every detail is so intricately and fully planned in advance - the experience is like zooming out of a painting. as you see more and more of the big picture, all the tiny incongruous details jump into place until everything finally fits. time and again i am made to marvel at the exceptional planning behind this show, never more so than in this episode.request timeout focusses on two storylines; elliot dealing with the fallout of last week's revelations, and darlene and dom pleading with janice. with the former, the big reveal has already happened and now we are picking up the pieces, as it were. we get a lot of great character development and we fill in some gaps created by last week's twist. in the latter storyline, we also get a twist, which has been set up very subtly throughout this season and which is incredibly satisfying to see unfold.incredible episodes are pretty much par for the course this season on mr. robot - we are racing towards the finish line - but however obvious it is, it still must be said that sam esmail really knows what the hell he's doing, and he has all along. best episode of the show and one of the best i've ever seen
 this episode was simply astounding. the music was hauntingly beautiful, the visuals... well it's san esmail, we already know what we're getting. the tension from the janice subplot was absolutely arresting, and the main plot had several hard-hitting moments. especially, of course, the final scene; that is genuinely one of the single best scenes of anything i've ever seen, probably top 5. my previous favourite before this was kill process but this episode simply had everything. i now truly believe mr. robot is the best series ever made and i didn't think i'd be saying that about another tv show for much much longer than this, but sam esmail and the crew have created a modern classic, and it's not even over yet. brilliant
 this episode hit hard in a very personal way. not only is elliot a survivor he's also a warrior of epic proportions. i thought everything was paced perfectly. the entire team really deserves a win on this one. and damn if i didn't shout out loud that janice got killed, her character was so repugnant i almost couldn't watch it because of her. to see her go down was pure satisfaction. this really broke me
 fast paced episode done everything perfectly once again. ending was so emotional. no wonder malek won oscar for portraying mercury. hope he gets awarded for this too. im out of words to describe how edgy, smart, original, well acted, directed and writed this show is. it is just pure art of cinematography. we don't deserve this show
 the direction of the episode was so amazing. every character was so perfectly written. sam esmail is a fu**ing genius 🔥 anxiety attack: the tv show
 that sounds like a bad thing, but trust me it's a good thing. hacking people, not computers.
 after last week's incredible capsule episode, full of emotional revelations and tension, this week deals with the fallout. it's not often that a tv show makes me cry, but the sheer tenderness and love that mr. robot shows was agonising is the face of everything elliot has been through. christian slater has felt rather underused this season, but his short appearance in this episode blew me away. he's an amazing actor, and the chemistry and empathy he and rami malek have for each other is devastating.i know the plot isn't exactly moving along at high speed, but this is elliot's show and always has been. bravo, everyone involved. sam esmail is a genius, and mac quayle again demonstrates his enormous range as a composer. the story is really coming together
 with only a few episodes left in the whole series, esmail is giving us answers and a very intriguing plot that makes you want to watch every episode as soon as possible. both plots were incredible in this episode with both being emotionally driven.
i am glad to see that the loose ends and sub plots are being wrapped up and we are looking at a show, that if it continues this quality, will be regarded as one of the best tv shows of all time so good!! it hurts!!
 i'm really short of words here to explain how i feel right now. the emotional battle of all the characters shown in this episode took me to such an emotional state that i'm here sharing it with you.this is yet another perfect episode. they created a backstory only for the purpose of the episode and turned it to a battle, a stuggle, a fight back and so on. it had immense suspense, thrill, emotion, action, surprises, scenes, cinematography, music and everything else you'd want.
i'm just glad i kept watching this show and it led me to awe each and every week.now just waiting to see how they conclude what would be one of the greatest seasons of tv history. spectacular thrilling episode!
 i love the intensity and brilliance in every scene! mr. robot is truly one of the greatest shows ever made, it proves how well done it is continuously throughout the series. i really hope there's emmy nods next year cause it deserves at least 10 of them just for season 4. an episode of payoffs.
 according to imdb's ratings, eps1.3_da3m0ns.mp4, the fourth episode of season one is the worst episode of this tv show.it is the episode where elliot suffers from withdrawals, and he hallucinates a lot of random-seeming stuff that isn't actually random. every little thing it set up slowly pays off, and it really feels like everything was planned from the very beginning, which makes it all the more satisfying.but other than that, this episode is a much needed break for elliot. he needs a damn break, and i feel like we needed it too. it was a logical decision.krista and elliot's goodbye was sweet, and i am happy even if that was their last conversation.the scenes with darlene, dom and janice were pretty compelling too. maybe the fact that they may have some sort of unspoken relationship was a bit heavy-handed but i didn't think it was a problem. it was pretty damn tense and i am still not sure who'll die and live.the resolution to that janice plotline was really well planned and i think it just shows how well written this series really is.all the stuff with elliot and mr. robot at the end was really fantastic. slater shows his range, and rami just continues to be magnificent in every way. i love their relationship in this series, it' s really complex and fascinating.i really want to see what happens next and i think that whatever sam esmail and his people have on their mind, is pretty much what i think would work for this show. i feel like i don't even have to stress it anymore how well the music fits and how amazing everything looks and feels. it's quite amazing honestly. it's just the way i'd want it.and now i'll take the opportunity to stress how genius the writing really is.the biggest setup and payoff is of course the sexual abuse, and that is explored a bit more upon in this episode.the key from da3m0ns is revealed to be the key of elliot's bedroom, he hid it so he can fight back and protect himself from his father - who is then revealed as his real monster from da3m0ns. it just makes perfect sense and is really really satisfying.the little girl with the scooter was revealed to be darlene at the end of season one, angela with querty was revealed to be that querty was with angela in the latter seasons. the only really big thing that is still not explained from that whole scene is that elliot was only born a month ago. everything gets revealed slowly and it' s amazing.thank you for this, and sorry guys for the long one but i had to... i had to write these things down. a positive episode of mr. robot?
 this show has rarely ever made me too emotional but i nearly cried three times this episode. either i didn't sleep enough last night or i'm super invested in this season and these characters. i think both.great episode, especially following up last week. the scenes with dom, darlene and janice were so intense, absolutely loved it. however easily the best scene was elliot and mr. robot reuniting. i've loved them working together this season and that scene really hammered home the father/son relationship they've developed. i think it was probably my favourite scene of the season, maybe the whole show.i'm gonna be ruined after the finale, i can already tell... excellent follow-up
 the final season of "mr. robot" has been getting almost everything right. the episode last week blew all of us away & continues to hold a 10/10 rating. so,it was a very tough act to follow. there is a huge recency bias when such episodes come up. i remember the episode after "ozymandias" didn't get as many claps,even though it was terrific. sam esmail somehow manages to hold the chips for a brilliant follow up to the last ep. the stakes are high,the acting is fantastic & tension abounds in every frame with janice. and all this while,the emotional threads stay intact.now to wait another week. this season is on fire, but....
 i really hope this is all gonna end in a satisfying way, because the only thing that could ruin this incredible show would be an unfitting finale. the actors are incredible, the pacing is astounding, everything is truly remarkable.
the only thing that bugged me in this episode was the plot twist when it was revealed that dominique managed to get help from from the "lucky irish bastard": the dark army (or just janice, for what we know) managed to find out that dominique got off on clips of darlene's interrogation tape, how could they/she not find out about this agreement she had with him? not a major problem, but still weird. incredibly maintains focus and builds on greatness with greatness
 this was (yet another) beautifully crafted episode. the script is tight, focused and intense. the acting yet again is superb as if it's ever not been and the score and cinematography continue to be outstanding, i particularly liked the spinning camera switching between darlene, dom and janice. the twist at the end of this episode also tied together some threads which up to this point had been scratching that part of my brain, it was delivered in an extremely satisfying, visceral way and although she was wonderfully creepily portrayed i'm glad to see the back of janice. how sam esmail and co. continue to piece together these masterpieces every week i have no idea but if the quality continues we're looking at one of if not the best final seasons in history. i'm going to give 408 request timeout a 9.6/10 why 9.7 when the episode is not even out?
 stop rating the episodes before watching them. over obsessive fans. i know the last episode was great but it doesn't mean that you should rate it before it airs my emotions are probably overriding my critical sense, right now.
 mind you, i don't see this episode as lower than a 9 out of 10 assuming i took a purely technical/objective approach to reviewing it. it's hard to see anything topping the 7th episode of this season in terms of execution, craft, timing, and intensity. and the 5th episode (405) was mindblowing in originality and execution. but i have to say the final scene of episode 8 grabbed me by the heart and is still holding on. if viewed as an allegory, this scene elevates the story beyond the specific to the universal. it's something that i suspect many, many viewers can relate to in their own experience (not necessarily confined to the effects of childhood abuse, but more about the way one can come to idealize or "re-create" a loved one yet knowing their flaws). we find this kind of treatment in the greatest works that ponder and reveal the human condition. i know i'm just commenting here in the first hour after viewing the episode, and maybe i'm getting carried away because i'm feeling so much for elliot's character, but i don't think i'm falling into hyperbole. this episode is that intense. this has to be one of the best and most satisfying tv show episodes i've ever seen
 when dom pulled out the knife from her lungs, stabbed the guard, picked his gun, and then shoot down him, the other guard, and janice, i started screaming "oh my god" (for at least 10 times), then i stood up from my computer and started jumping like a mad man for at least a minute straight.i mean believe me, i really, really, really wanted that unbearable psychopath janice to die. yesterday after i've watched the previous four episodes, i fantasized in my head about different ways how i would like janice to be finally killed. and it happened!it was one of the most satisfying and awesome moments i've ever seen in a tv show. it reminds me of through the looking glass from lost, felina from breaking bad, hardhome and battle of the bastards from game of thrones, or "a" from the walking dead (it's the season finale of the fourth season).it's also an episode that was filled with tension and suspense, with great acting, amazing ambient soundtrack, excellent pacing and a heavy dose of feelings - the whole episode was emotionally impactful, especially the ending. it made my shake, it made me cry.this show is freaking masterpiece. amazing episode
 mind blowing episode once again. this season beats all elliot has reborn
 this episode give a me feel like elliot finally is doing what he wants, since wanting a hug until trying to understand his youngest self for a better self-way. so satisfying
 this episode mainly focuses on darlene and dom and janice and boy oh boy the tension is amazing as normal and has some twists im 1 inch away from crying
 eliot anderson is one of the greatest characters in the history of tv. and this episode is a proof. elliot tries to keep moving forward
 great episode, especially considering how revelatory last week's was.it speaks so much to me that elliot's younger self showed elliot what he did as a child to fight back. to keep elliot moving forward knowing he wasn't taking his father's abuse lying down. it makes perfect sense now that i see it that elliot actually needs mr. robot now more than ever. just because he resembles his father doesn't mean he is his father. he's just the father elliot has needed, but didn't have.janice hurts dom to get information out of darlene, and it's brutal. i knew something was going to come from dom reaching out to deegan mcguire, but this was even more satisfying than i expected. dom is so strong-willed when it comes to her family that she's the exception to the rule that dark army moles start taking on evil traits like everyone we've seen so far. i'm hoping dom survives after she took out janice and saved darlene but if she doesn't, this honestly feels like a good send off to her character. she saved her family and the woman she had a romantic connection with, putting herself before others just like she's done since her character was introduced. good episode but come on guys, not every episode will be a 9 or 10
 i enjoyed this one, but some of the people here were rating it 10 before it even aired! and anyone who gives its less than a 10 gets a thumbs down looool.. half the episode with darlene and dom was excellent but the other half was just decent. one thing that i also didn't like is how easy elliot and krista escaped. second, when the kid took elliot to the museum they could have reveled something bigger and finally the final few minutes of the episode did not tell us what we already did not know. still though i enjoyed the episode, but come on guys not ever episode is going to be "the greatest in the history of television" its getting a bit too much. going up again
 mr robot this time is unbelievable ,, can't expect anything more than that ,, i am glad with this show the showdown we've been waiting for since the pilot
 going all the way back to the opening lines of the pilot, the characters in this show have had one very clear goal; to take down the top 1% of the top 1% - the ones in control, the ones who play god without permission. that's what the 5/9 hack in season 1 was supposed to do, but fsociety's agenda was co-opted by the very people they were trying to fight. since then, the series has focussed more on a scramble to survive the dark army and elliot's internal conflict with mr. robot. this season, however, with the reveal of the deus group and elliot's recruitment of phillip price, we have finally been presented with hope that our heroes might complete this goal - and this is the episode where it all comes to a head.one of my favourite dynamics in the show is that between phillip price and whiterose, and we get a lot of them this episode. i just love it when you have two intelligent schemers exchanging snide remarks - littlefinger and varys from game of thrones come to mind. their verbal repartee in this episode serves as a microcosm of the fsociety v deus group conflict, and plays to the strengths of both actors. michael cristofer is particularly delightful as price, coasting through nearly the entire episode with a smug sense of satisfaction that drives whiterose up the walls.if it hasn't already been made clear by the monumental events that have occurred so far in season 4, this episode should remove any doubt that we are in the endgame of the series. we only have 4 episodes left, and while there is still a lot to address, i feel increasingly sure that the end of this show will leave me completely and utterly satisfied. my favorite show
 nothing has really touched me mentally as much as this show. i can't collect my thoughts after every episode because of how amazed and mesmerized i am with this masterpiece of a show. this inspires me to want to write and direct for myself and if i ever do sam will be my guide. this show has everything i've ever wanted from a show. the music is so flawless, the cinematography, development of characters. it's really what ignites the already amazing plot of mr. robot to greater heights. i've never felt so much for a character in a show as much as i have for elliot. jesse comes really close from breaking bad but elliot has taken the throne. how his character breaks but still holds on for those he cares about which is darlene, himself, and those who lost the battle.price was also amazing in this episode. his development took a big jump in season 3 and concluded with this episode. he left with a bang and it was satisfying to watch. just like when ollena tyrell died in got but with a win haha. this episode is 9.8+++++ sam esmail, you beautiful genius.
 heart racing the entire episode. thank you, sam. i'm
gonna be quite sad when this journey is over in a few weeks. it happened!
 won't give spoilers, watch it yourself.
edge of my seat the entire episode and the payoff was phenomenal.
michael cristofer (price) & bd wong (zhang) shined throughout the episode. the writing, screenplay, cinematography and score as usual - top notch!sad that the show is ending, but it's going off on such a high note that no one can complain. payoff... feels so good
 so many times throughout this show the characters we care about try to do certain things and something always seems to go wrong, and whiterose is always in control. but now, everything goes wrong for her, and it feels so good!!!elliot, darlene, dom, mr robot, price, they worked so hard and suffered for this, and it's glorious. thank you sam esmail, i don't know how you do it. incredible.
 bd wong and michael cristofer shined in another amazing episode of mr robot. both gave such phenomenal performances that left me in awe. i loved the phone conversation between mr robot and whiterose and how elliot came back after hearing angela's name. the music made it seem like to me that she was trying to brainwash elliot, but i could be wrong. i'm extremely curious what whiterose meant by saying angela is not dead. was it just a weak attempt at a lie? or is there something more there we don't know about yet..? after elliot and darlene were successful with the deus group hack, whiterose lost her mind. i loved her slow descent into madness throughout the episode that resulted in her completely losing her mind and going off the rails at the end, killing phillip price right there in the open for everyone to see. phillip's character arc feels so perfectly completed, i loved it so much. also, the entire soundtrack was so incredible. such a great episode and now only 4 more to go! i mean.....can this series get any better ! this is television at its peak !
 holy moly, what an absolutly amazing, beautiful masterpiece of television this episode was !a payoff 4 years in the making !this season is just.......i cant find words for it !m.a.s.t.e.r.p.i.e.c.e it's like we got a finale early
 the episode we've been waiting for since the season 3 finale, hell, the pilot. whiterose undoes nearly everything she's worked for and it's amazing to watch it all unfold. i love how price's arc ends with him actually getting to watch whiterose lose, so in a way he gets to finally win.and that first scene was insane. so the elliot we've been seeing this whole time since the pilot has not been the real elliot. the "other one" is the real elliot. the connections this will make will surely blow my mind and i cannot wait to see mr. robot show elliot whatever he "did" to bring him back.cannot wait for more. "he did mention something about wanting to travel the great southwest in a '65 el camino convertible"
 vince gilligan gave us two endings of breaking bad, this episode was like a ending(finale) itself also. i personally think that sam esmail will give us two endings of mr robot as well. (for those who wanna know, this line is at 17:40) season of payoffs.
 everything that was set up in earlier seasons is now slowly but surely paying off in season 4. this episode in an of itself was so satisfying. although it breaks my heart to see price die in this way, it feels earned and it adds a lot to the finality of this season. he went out like a boss. it looks like whiterose has snapped, and i can't wait for her resolution. i hope they won't bring back angela because her death meant a lot for the show and the characters, and it's good this way.the hack has finally gone trough. the top 1 percent of the top 1 percent is finished off. and it was glorious. it paid off and i love that it did, this show is just so amazing. the cinematography, sets and the clever zooming out and editing were all great.but what about that conversation at the beginning? i feel like the next few episodes will be about that convo and that room, and what it all means.but it was really uplifting and surprising. another great hour of television. on the edge of my seat the entire episode
 elliot's actually done it the madlad. seriously though everything in this episode was perfect (as always) personality
 i think the first person of elliot is that kid, that hate his father
the second person is mr. robot
and the last person is the elliott that we know from episode 1 of season 1.
.
.
.
i think the kid to forget his bad memories of his father created mr. robot and then after that mr. robot to help elliot to raise and to do not stay in his childhood created the elliot.
.
.
.
because of this we see in season 1 that elliot not recognise his sister and try to kiss her. this is because that elliot is just born and do not have any idea about his past and memories. mac quale is a genius
 this episode is so we'll crafted - from the music, to the cinematography to the acting - that it barely feels like ten minutes have passed before the credits are rolling. another solid episode
 sam esmail & his team have been churning out great episode after great episode in s4.this episode plays out like a season finale.the hack goes at lightning speed & the characters trump(pun intended) the odds in very satisfying scenes.darlene was the true mvp in this episode.she does fantastic stuff with the python script.whiterose & philip duke it out in a game of mental poker,with all stakes in price's hands.a lot more happens & it seems the show is moving towards a happy ending.there are still a lot of unanswered questions though.there was a short tease at the beginning,but the episode took a different route altogether.we should be back at that thread in the coming episodes & i seriously doubt we'll have a happy ending. conflict indeed
 good pacing, nice tension. well rounded episode, one of my favorites this season illuminati confirmed
 my chest hurts from how tense this episode was, i'm gonna need a lie down and a glass of whiskey! in this episode we finally get the "conflict" between fsociety and the deus group, the opening lines of the first ever episode set this conflict up and if the deus group are bowling pins then this week, elliot and darlene are the ball. we get more ominous hints to a possible twist involving elliot's seemingly many personalities, we get more whiterose and phillip which is never a bad thing and we get ever closer the origins of whiterose's mysterious "project" the machine. (i still think it's a time machine) other show runners would have used this episode as an opportunity for mindless action and violence and although we do get some of the latter this episode is on the surface, slow and methodical but underneath that surface is a break neck thrill ride which will keep anyone who's been paying attention on the edge of their seat. i also would like to add that the final scenes between phillip and whiterose are some of my favourites in the whole show, phillip finally got the better of her and even though price is the one left lifeless at the bottom of the stairs he is the true victor. not much else to say but another incredible hour of television from esmail and co. i'm going to give 409 conflict a 9.9 who rated the episode less than 10 *angryface*
 the joke aside.... i wasn't speechless when the episode ended, no, i laughed for 5 minutes straight at the pure perfection i had just witnessed. the acting was phenomenal as ususal, the build up masterfuly executed, the different camera shots... man.. the guy behind the camera is omega level genius.
storywise i'm really exited what comes next. all the hints about "a machine" might confirm the "time travel theory". though mr. robot indirectly asked elliot if he wanted to go back and fix everything in episode 8.
no idea what to say... this is film-making beyond description and rating.
hall of fame for sure!!! another great episode
 this is probably on par with 407, the acting and the filmmaking are incredible and we have had 2 of the greatest episodes ever to be aired on tv in the space of two weeks. here is to hoping the last four episodes will be just as good absolutely outstanding...
 this was probably the best episode of any show out there that i have ever seen. needed to create an account just to write a review. trumped
 anyone else see the backside of trump at the deus party??? about 20 min in.
awesome show! can't wait to see what's coming! what a mastepiece!
 the tension throughout the episode is unmatched, i have never experienced emotions so strong watching an tv episode, i was shaking. apart from the plot which is amazing, the cinematography and the music are insanely good. in my opinion, this is one of the best tv episodes in the entire history of television. terrific
 i do have to say, this is possibly the best episode i've seen so far. utterly gripping, with brilliant editing.my wife happened to watch this with me. i don't think she's seen any other mr robot episode, and she was hooked all the way through without even knowing the back story or characters. wow
 this show keeps surprising me at every turn by keeping me on the edge of my seat because mr robot never has a dull moment since every detail in the scenes. i found the ending to be absolutely disturbing with the death of one of my favorite characters but man phillip went out in the best possible way. only 3 episodes but i'm excited to see how this masterpiece of a show comes to an end. sam esmail let us dream of a better world
 the moment we've been all waiting for ! i am so excited for the rest of the season if we finaly get this better world without the top 1% from the top 1% and how this world will look like ... perfect final season
 to all the creators out there, this is how you end a show. this season is the best season in any television show ever. in defense of this episode... (you guys are harsh lol)
 this episode is about 1 thing: giving darlene and dom rest after the sever trauma that they have gone through this season, especially dom. i've read many reviews saying that the ending was anticlimactic, but you guys are missing the point. sam esmail isn't giving us what we want, he's giving us what these characters need. dom needs a break. darlene needs to go back because, unlike dom, there is something for her back at home: elliot.for the entirety of the episode, there are wonderful dialogue moments where it is made very clear that darlene and dom needed the break that they are given in this episode. darlene's work isn't done, but dom's work is done. dom needs to get away, darlene needs to stay for her brother.so many people are calling this episode a filler episode, but no one really complained about episode 4, when elliot, mr. robot, and tyrel are literally walking around the forest for 40 minutes. but this episode, an episode full of wonderful character moments, an amazing cameo by our favorite dark army operative from season 3, and an ending that fits our characters and leaves us questioning what part darlene will play in the ending of this show, is boring?sure, this episode isn't the best episode of mr. robot. it certainly is the worst episode this season. but it is vital for the characters in the episode and leaves questions as to who will die and who will live happily ever after. i feel like we just got trolled, in a good way.
 this episode features incredible character development, dialogue, & cinematography like most episodes of mr. robot. we got a great goodbye scene with elliot and darlene, along with so many great moments between darlene and dom. darlene running away and dom running back.. everything felt like it was leading up to a dramatic, crushing, shocking conclusion. instead we got a cut to black, with no dramatic, crushing, or shocking conclusion. i thought this was a great episode, i loved seeing leon & irving again, and i actually love how sam esmail was making it too obvious that everything was leading up to something insane at the end, then doing the complete opposite. some people might be mad at "nothing" happening or call this a boring, filler episode. although i can see where they're coming from, i respectfully disagree. this episode isn't a filler and there is why
 i have read some of the critics and i have to say that i respectfully disagree with them. for me a filler episode, is an episode that is made to extend the length of the show or mainly, in anime due to the way episode are produced, to fill the gap between the release of two episodes and most of the time, the plot has nothing to do with the main plot of the series.but 410 gone doesn't fall in any of those two categories, in addition to being a masterclass on how to play with expectations, the episode is very important regarding character development because it concludes both darlene and dom character arcs.darlene has succeeded in her goals, redistribute the wealth to everyone, bringing economic justice to the world but that deed as impressive as it is, has not resolve her confidence issues and her anxiety of loneliness. when she is about to take the plane, she falls again into her demons, freaks out and leave thus missing the return of dom, which makes it frustrating for us the audience and tragic for the character but in that instant of panic, darlene overcome her fears and by doing that opens herself a way toward self-improvement and well-being and we, the audience, can imagine her joining to cyber division mentioned by dom because of her desire for justice.dom is all about control, laws and responsibility and as we know "control is an illusion". if i enjoyed this episode so much it's because we witness the collision between dom's desire for control and the opposite way of thinking of darlene, leon and irving, i really find it hilarious when leon isn't able to remember the barn or when irving discuss all the horrible events that happen like it was no big deal and dom can not even apprehend the fact that the dark army isn't anymore after her or her family because in her mind she disobey and the rules have to be followed, she has to be punished like santiago.
each character is this episode advise dom to give up control, whether it's darlene that tells her to wait, accept the fact of not knowing and appreciate the moment, or leon who says that "jackie" can become everything she wants, by the way, we can also observe dom's obsession to have control over everything when she starts to invent a backstory for her new identity and even irving who literally said to her "take it easy", it can't be more transparent than that.
i have seen some people theorizing that something would happen to the plane because of irving presence but i really think that it's just a coincidence. for me the plane is a metaphor for leaving things behind, giving up control, dom wasn't able to sleep well before because of her strive for control but in the plane for the first time she does it with ease and there we have the end of dom's character journey.i hope you have taken the time to read all of the critic and know you're convinced that this episode wasn't a filler not bad as everyone portraying it
 i really enjoyed the episode. dom and darlene deserved this epsiode tbh. sam is a genius. he gives all the characters same importance in his episodes. such as : he made vera the main man in episode 7 and price in episode 9. that's why, i love sam. i am really surprsed by seeing people complaining a lot. maybe, they expect thriller and some actions in every episode but that's not gonna happen. this episode is also a good one. we can see how darlene gonna cope up with her fear and dom gonna have some nice time staying out from all the problems. the ending disheartened me a lot. maybe, they were supposed to be happy but not with each other. wow. the ending was extremely upsetting.
 i actually loved the weary mood of this episode, it felt like limbo for darlene and dom. joey badass made the episode in my opinion. however, the ending could not have been more frustrating. sam esmail, please tell me if i am missing something because i usually am thrilled by your cliff-hangers but this one just angered me. overall, it was a solid episode, but i will have to watch an episode of veep to unwind after dom and darlene missed each other in the airport. bobby cannavale is a legend
 right when it panned onto the beach towel books, i screamed. lolstill a solid ep tho, got a touching goodbye from darlene and elliot, some great character scenes with dom and darlene, and some even better moments from leon and irving. yeah, it isn't balls to the wall like previous ep's, and the ending was a little cheesy imo, but it was a nice change of pace, and i'm sure sam has something else up his sleeve. he always does nothing is random
 it seems strange irving just "appeared" in the airport, something really bad is going to happen, this series have been doing this to us since the beggining.
it was a very good episode btw. what's with all ?
 you cannot expect to get same super thrilling episode we got last week, we have to cool down, and now when don is it out of picture eliot is the one we will focus in next episodes. cannot believe there are only 3 episodes left of this great show !!! character-driven to the core
 dom and darlene lead this cooldown episode, and i love their dynamic. i never realized before this episode how different, but how similar at the same time, these two are. darlene struggles to handle taking care of herself because she's always chosen to take care of other people and dom has always chosen living through her job without ever giving herself a break. the ending allows these two to confront their biggest flaws as characters, the answer to dom and darlene becoming better people isn't in their relationship with one another, it's in them going outside their comfort zones. the only way to change is to take action.leon was entertaining as hell and seeing irving again was a trip. it makes sense that the dark army is buckling down on something very specific and have no time for dom. they're most likely scrambling to figure out what to do with the washington township plant, since it's been whiterose's biggest motivation for this entire series. i'm so excited to see elliot find out what whiterose's project actually is, it's hard to believe that we're getting the answer to mr. robot's biggest mystery in just one week.also i can't wait for elliot to figure out what's going on in his head. and for him to narrate at least one more time. the endgame of mr. robot is on the horizon. went in skeptical after hearing mixed things, genuinely loved this one...
 the ending reminded me of a somehow more tragic casablanca, i was so heartbroken and that's how i know i love this show, i'm so emotionally invested in the characters and story, thanks to sam esmail's incredible mind for creating... this! i was strangely enough thinking if we were ever going to see irving again and as soon as i saw beach towel on sale i said to my girlfriend "that's the book he was writing" and then he came on screen and we cheered, bobby canavale is an absolute powerhouse and i didn't realise how much i missed his presence in the show until he was back, i really hope we somehow see him again before the end. also the scene with darlene and dom on the bench as fsociety redistribute the deus groups ill gotten gains is one of my favourites this season and that's saying something. this season hadn't had a weak link before this for me and that didn't change this week. a slower episode but a welcome one. 9.0/10 p.s can get an appreciation thread for my boy joey bada$$? never an dull moment with leon. not gonna rate this episode just yet
 this episode frustrated me a lot and i'll rate it once i know where it will lead to.. but still, i trust sam esmail. loved this episode
 it was a way slower pace than the last few episodes but it needed to be this slow to clean up things before the last three episodes. i really loved the darma and the character development in this episode. don't be so quick to judge
 have you learned nothing? whilst seemingly very little appeared to happen, you can bet there is a set up for one of the final episodes.have a little faith in sam. he hasn't let us down yet... it's as if some people don't understand the show
 look, i get it, some people like faster paced episodes and do not care as much for the slow-paced, more emotion-driven episodes. that's fine. but it seems as if certain people are forgetting what some of the basic concepts of this show are.a typical network show might have, say, a wunderkind with some sort of disorder (see good doctor). here we have: a world-class hacker, probably on the spectrum, with a serious personality disorder and a very troubled past including sexual abuse. we had the manifestation of the disorder playing a full character role you have the opponents being a massive evil corporation and an international group of the top 1% of the 1% and their killing/influencing apparatus. we have actions taken that affect the entire world. we have a gender-fluid/villain(ess). we have the possibility of virtual reality/time travel. we have a whole group of characters made interesting in their own rights. that is a whole lot to unpack.now, economically, their high-action shows have cost huge $$$ with shooting locations, hundreds of extras, special effects etc. so to counter this, he could have a) gone the game of thrones route - cutting the number of episodes or spreading it all out to yet another season with much more filler, rushing through the emotional/deeply personal aspects of the show and personal development or b) do what sam did - expand the show from 10 to 13 episodes. it seems that exactly 3 episodes will be low-key and lower budget, they fill in much of the emotional details/character development stuff and yet you have not lost a single action-based episode. it seems like a winning combination to me.also, so many things in previous seasons were about non-hack-related issues. hacking krista and her former boyfriend, the whole jail stay, the extended scenes with trenton and mobley. this show has never failed to stop, slow down and look at motivations and character development.here we are seeing that. sam is so far giving a great ending to each of the principle characters. in this episode, we have dom and darlene being told what they really need and they ultimately get it: dom needs to let go of things, find a new place in the world and take a timeout to refind herself. darlene needs to understand that she can function alone, she is strong and capable, she just needs the push to discover she can control her own destiny and does not walk in anybody's shadow. their wishes just do not coincide. i expect this is the last we will see of dom unless their is an epilogue, maybe of her and darlene relaxing in budapest. we will see.this is also a show that has challenged tv genres from the start: the 80's sit-com, the theater play, the silent episode etc. here we had a play on the sit-com. it was the typical "racing through the airport" bit, but with a twist. i also think it was a small poke in the eye to the folks who predicted a plane crash all along. i see zero payoof or plot development in something happening to dom - the dark army could have followed her home etc. or they could have called in a bomb threat to shut down the airport. i think the point here was just for darlene and dom to get where they need to go, just not the same way, literally and metaphroically.i think the leon and irving scenes were sublime, irving is basically a used car salesman. he clearly is happy just being on his cheesy book tour and scoping out airports. maybe it will be something bigger but i doubt it - this was the perfect ending - he is happy with selling books at some barnes and noble instead of killing. and leon is much the same - really a smart operator, well-read and educated, for whom the killing was just an occupation.for those who complain, i ask if the show would have been better had they skipped these character development issues. i don't think so. the personal side has always been as important as the hack/dark army and i'd argue in this season they are given at least equal weight. as in real life, huge changes in the world are often directly linked to the dramas in an individual life, ellliot and white rose had traumatic personal experiences that shaped their worldwiews and led to these events. and again you are losing nothing by having some episodes focusing on the emotional/personal underpinnings of the characters. requiem for a dream
 has anyone noted the tribute to requiem for a dream at the beginning when dom is cooking her toast? this alone is worth the 10 stars. something bad is about to happen
 i don't think irving would randomly appears like that. that shot of the book at the ending, i think it means that something happened without us knowing (a bomb, or a gps). i just think that would be stupid if he ramdomly appears for a cameo and wtf they would just keep something gave by him, since he is an enemy.
it would be the reason that darlene didn't take the flight, even without knowing about what will happen.that acting was on point, you could see the despair on darlene's eyes when dom said she won't go with her. the soundtrack matches with the personality of these two characters and it was beautiful. can y'all stop reviewing
 i know you guys are excited but atleast wait for the episode to drop before giving your opinions on it mindblowing doesn't even begin to cover it
 this episode is the missing piece that will finally allow mr. robot to eclipse twin peaks as my favourite show of all time. for three seasons, sam esmail has been taking out narrative cheques; mystery after mystery, intoxicating and frustrating at the same time. now, in this fourth and final season, he's finally cashing them.perhaps the most unknowable question the show has presented us with up to this point is whiterose's mysterious project in the washington township nuclear power plant - and that's what this episode is all about. up until now, everything we've heard about it has been vague and surreal; a mythical science fiction construct seemingly detached from the type of story we are telling. in this episode, however, we finally find out exactly what it is and what it's supposed to do. then, we get a crazy twist that i definitely can't talk about.if this episode is any indication, we are in for one of the greatest finales ever made. i don't want it to be over, but i'm so excited to see how it ends. my mind is shattered
 this episode completely blew my mind and has left me feeling awestruck. rami malek & bd wong deserve emmy's for that incredible scene between elliot and whiterose. whiterose killing herself was shocking as hell, along with the revelation of there being a parallel world created by her machine!! elliot having flashes of the real world while in the parallel world, along with him seeing the real world version of himself at the very end (plus the preview for the finale) makes me think elliot didn't actually die, but still went to the parallel world somehow. also, i loved seeing so many returning characters, both major and minor in both worlds.we are left asking so many questions and with there only being the two-part series finale left to give answers, we're all wondering how the heck sam esmail is gonna pull this off. that being said, i have complete faith in him & think we're in for one of the most insane, masterful series finales to ever air. whew...
 all i'm going to say is, this show will be studied for many years to come. one of the greats. it all makes sense now!
 first of all may i say the acting of the two was phenomenal!secondly my own guess is that this is all an endless loop. this is a totally different reality (the current one).just remember where it all started. elliot doesn't remember his sister (an only son in new reality) ecorp(fcorp in new reality) (5/9 hack 5/9 door open so he goes back to his current reality(his choice as wr said), 5,9 magniture earthquake on washingtown township. in the end he meets himself in te new reality to restart again. then we'll prolly get a 6/9 dcorp and so on .. who knows.point is sam esmail is a genius. rami malek, bd wong, christian slater did a fantastic job in the episode, mac quayle's tone was perfectly set and the cinematography and tone were perfect as always. i cannot wait for next week!
honestly this show is a masterclass in any aspect! what's next elliot alderson?
 i think what we actually saw in the final scenes is about that elliot's true reality is the one with f corp and stuff like that. the elliot who lives in this perfect world is the real one.
he still hates people, loves angela and his family - who stand up for him.
he is happy (?) and still has multiple personalities which he suppress(4 actually, plus the real one).
and like most of this kind of people does, he also lives in his head - trying to save the world.remember back where mr robot, little elliot and his mother sat at the table? a chair was empty! whose chair? well, that's what we're about to find out in the last few episodes left.my guess the happy elliot is the real one, while the elliot we've been following for 4 seasons is the missing one from the table.that elliot for 4 seasons is struggling to become happy. and for that, he sacrificed everything. there's no other explanation, parallel stuff is just bs here - wrapped in multiple personalities' delusions, making no sense.in his mind actually twisted 5/9, e corp, his father, angela, whiterose, etc.
for what purpose?
well, imo this is his way to express fsociety.at least that's what i see up until now. :)
2 episodes left, i'm really curious about the final conclusion. good show :) if you think that any tv show cannot suprise you
 ...you should watch this. maybe the most intelligent show ever. and acting and atmosphere is pure art as always. only golden globe nominee in this series 2020 is because of rami malek. really hope he wins! mr. robot's finest hour
 only once in a while, an episode of a show will come along that changes everything. i thought it was 407, however, "exit" comes through with the finest hour of television i have ever seen.this changes everything, and makes me so excited for the series finale. i don't want to spoil anything, just take my word for it.sam esmail & crew, you've done it again. bravo. fantastic!
 while the last episode disappointed a lot of viewers,this episode more than made up for it.we start right where ep. 9 ended.wr has managed to escape from fbi's clutches.elliot makes it to the washington township to completely destroy wr.the conversation between elliot & wr was excellent writing.while their belief systems seem similar,the subtleties set them completely apart.wr realises this & sets into motion a bizarre set of events.the following scenes had serious s2 vibes.we see what we see but are aware that something is off.bd wong & rami malek were excellent in their parts.the episode ends at the best possible moment.everything is in place now for a knockout of a series finale. limitless
 literally, if timeline way a scroll bar i can control, i'd skip every possible event for this week in order to get to the next one and watch the next piece episode.the cast never stops to amaze us. feels, thrills, reliefs, joys, griefs; you will get to experience all types of feelings in such an episode.
well done, 10/10 holy s**t
 this is one of the most mind blowing episodes of television i've ever seen. for weeks i've been thinking the show would take an unexpected turn for the weird but this... wow. the intro picking up where we left off at the end of conflict was incredible. the soundtrack throughout was as always masterful. bd wong's performance is a particular standout. this episode is so surreal and just mental on a whole other level. it's really impossible to talk about this episode without spoiling it or going off on a tangent but i can say that i quite loudly screamed a few times this episode. jesus h i'm not sure what to think or do now... 10 out of 10. i'm done. rachmaninoff prelude op. 3 no. 2
 in the classical world of music there's this tendency that the composers have a negative relationship with their most highly praised and popular pieces of grandeur.chopin hated his fantaisie impromptu, op. 66; ravel, his bolero; liszt didn't let his students play his sonata in b minor(because they couldn't play it right); and most interestingly in relation to this episode of mr. robot - exit, rachmaninoff had enough of playing his prelude in c-sharp minor, op. 3 no. 2 at every concert because of the popularity of the piece.however grim, these events are beautiful in their own way. they make these composers very human.about op. 3 no. 2 the legend goes: sergei rachmaninoff is at a funeral and people in black clothing are standing around an open grave and mourning before a final goodbye. sergei joins the bunch and bends over to look down into the grave. horror strikes as he realize it is he himself lying in the grave. second page starts playing from your fingers and goosebumps set in.i've been playing quite a lot of piano through my young years, and the thought of that story gave me goosebumps every time i got to the second page of playing the prelude, imagining looking down on myself in a grave.when i watched the last 20 seconds of exit, i got goosebumps, and that is very rare for me. i can't explain the strong feeling i felt from this plot twist other than associating it with the stomach-turning piece written by rachmaninoff. the legend lives on. no paralell universes
 so everyone's thinking there are paralell universes, but if we just look at the series it won't go to this sci-fi stuff. whiterose meant heaven/a better place(in my opinion) to be the "paralell universe" where you can only get if you die. she gave elliot a choice to enter this paralell universe. but it might be just one of elliot's mindgoings. afterall, this episode was just crazy, and had lot off messages to the viewer. this is a series you must watch. "who are you?" aka my mind is shattered!
 let me start this off by saying bravo to rami malek and b.d wong. world class performances yet again with their duologue, absolutely mesmerising.
now on to the plot. oh my god! my mind is shattered, sam esmail has been hinting at whiterose's project being a time machine or alternate reality device, something along those lines. looks like he went with the latter, so now we have a parallel universe 😱. or do we? is this all in elliot's head, is he having a bad dream? did the nuclear plant really blow up (i don't think so)? so many questions, which is why i love this show so much. this show will be talked about for years to come with a cult following that i'm a part of. i wouldn't be surprised if elliot snapped out of it to see him back at the plant, this could go down a lot of directions. it made me think back when elliot kissed darlene and forgot that was his sister. we find out that's because mr robot shut him out, but is it because elliot was in a relationship with her in an alternate universe, and his mind is struggling to keep come? probably not, but i'm excited for the 2 hour season finale next week, which should be one of the greatest finales of all time. we still haven't seen the third personality and what "they did" as said by mr robot a few episodes ago, it makes you think is this a "dream" of the third personality is he/she going to come out of her shell and save elliot? who knows, i just hope sam doesn't over complicate it and take away from quality of the episode, i have faith he's done excellent so far. but i'm so sad it's coming to an end next week, we've had really great times. the episode ends with elliot walking into his apartment upon seeing "earth 1" elliot and says "who are you?" i just know the acting will be insane next episode. so, recap in "earth 2": elliot's dad is still alive and not a weirdo, elliot is an only child, and we see him the day before he's about to marry his childhood crush angela who is alive! e corp is now f corp & elliot is the ceo of allsafe. tyrell is back too, which pretty much confirms his death in the current "earth 1" reality. speaking of deaths, whiterose shoots herself in front of elliot. she really believes in her machine creating the possibility for a new life wow. so much has happened.we're in for one last final ride next week, buckle up because the show is about to go out with a bang.
10/10 for this episode, beautifully constructed leaving the viewer in suspense wanting more. mind is blown
 the creator of this show ' mr sam esamil' should be in museum for his unique way of telling the story. i really dont know what just happened in last 20 minutes, i was just enjoying the life elliot was having. but at the end i felt like mine mind is the one that got brain washed. epic show wow, what just happened?
 the writing was mind blowing, the directing was fantastic and the acting was outstanding as always.
after today's epic episode my mind is as messed up as much as eliot's.
only 2 more to go, i don't want the ride to ever end i'll wait for the finale to rate it, but filmmaking-wise it's really good.
 nice music, and powerful compositions, impressive and intentional cinematography as always, with both rami and wong killin' it. they were actually mindblowing. but if we really saw an alternate universe after the red blur, i think the show is actually ruined. hear me out. the show was always about very real people and very real struggles, and it wouldn't make much sense if they traded realism for awesomeness. yeah it could be fun, but i prefer the idea of this all being in elliot's head. a twist like this could undo all the consequences of the first few seasons and it'd make it all... worthless. i hope it's not the case, but frankly, elliot is crazy enough to imagine something like this. the season finale will either make this one of the best shows ever, or kill the whole thing. i hope it's the former. girl.....
 bjtch! youre! not! twin! peaks!but sam esmail is a genius tho 🤔 if kubrick did tv....
 i usually try to shy away from hyperbole and over-exaggeration when reviewing (verbally, or in print) something i've seen, but i truly believe that the closest thing we have to kubrick's brilliance in this day and age is probably david lynch and sam esmail.kubrick famously said that if you can think a thing and you can write a thing, then you can film that thing too. both lynch and esmail reinforce kubrick's hypothesis in spades.truly remarkable episode. truly remarkable show. pretty amazing television wise - the direction is love or hate, but we still have to see what we really saw
 the episode, television wise was amazing and on par with the best ever - the best for this show and the best for tv shows in general -, but the direction where the show went was a classic you either love it or hate it. i'm not a big fan of having expectations on where a show has to go, except for blatant mistakes or cheap stuff, tbh. anyway, we still have to know if it's really an alternative dimension, like one would think without really analyzing the situation, or a simulation, or an "allucination" etc. i don't know what people who are shocked were watching until this point honestly. we always knew that wr had a sci-fi type of project, and at this point it was clear that it was in the alternative world stratosphere, only ifs where: will she be able to pull it off (as in, will elliot stop her)? and: will it really work? my mind is gone
 sam esmail shattered my brain into a million pieces and scattered them across the universe.
this series is a piece of art. groundbreaking storytelling with the usual flawless cinematography, acting and soundtrack. what is real.. what is not?
 every question that mr robot answer about a plot leads to even more questions..this is what i love about this show , from start to end it engages you in such a way that you just can't keep your eyes off the screen. this episode is the the perfect example of that. this is television at its best !!. one of the greatist episodes ever
 my mind still can not believe what happend in this episode , it was absolutely worth the wait brilliant again!
 the opening was particularly great tonight! you just knew you were in for a treat! the use of the beach boys' : "heroes and villains" was simply genius! whoever thought up that one... give them an emmy right now!! just for that!!
i'm not even going to attempt to describe where the episode took us from there. no spoilers here. but, honestly, i wouldn't know where to begin. the entire series has been brilliant. some episodes - like this - are sheer perfection. a phenomenal penultimate episode
 this episode follows our elliot's pov leading up to the shocking reveal at the end of 4x11. i loved the slow buildup leading to elliot facing felliot. i am absolutely shocked at elliot apparently being a made up superhero by felliot & then elliot killing him at the end. still so many questions left to be answered in the final episode, but wow what a penultimate episode!!! also, the end credits being a red screen was a great touch! hello friend
 so good that he finally talked with us...
this was great do i sense a little bit of coherence here?
 still the conversation part is totally mind blowing. this episode actually has slowed down the pace. after watching this first part of the finale, i still have absolutely no idea where it's going, but that's the greatest part of this series am i right? don't judge me...
 incredible penultimate episode. works in tandem with exit and has an insanely intense and disturbing ending. i'm equal parts scared and excited going into part two. best tv series ever
 put simply, this is tv that surpasses everything before it. from the first scene of series one, episide one, to the penultimate episode in the final series, this excels at every level. the writing, the acting, the cinematography, the music, the colour, the editing, the costumes, the characters -- the mise en scene -- it blows everything else out of the fu**ing water. sam esmail is a genius. a totally unstable genius. brilliant!!! how can you give to this episode lower than 10 ?
 the most perfect episode in tv series episode and the greatest message ive ever take from a movie. how do i take off a mask if i am being a mask
 i can't believe this is the end....this episode was amazing....this is the best show i have ever seen in my entire lifw i can feel the seconds ticking down, and i still have no idea where we're going
 to be clear, this is just a review of part 1. i have not yet watched part 2, and i will be reviewing it separately. it's taking all the willpower i have not to play it right this second, but i have to finish my review of this episode first.this is probably the most frustrating episode of mr. robot since season 2 episode 11... mostly in a good way. similar to that episode, we get little plot progression, and what we do get is incredibly obtuse. most of the episode is spent filling in the other side of the final sequence from 411; we see what our elliot was up to in the time between our arrival in this parallel world (if that is what it is) and the meeting of the two. as such, there is a sense that we aren't getting anywhere; we've basically seen this already. still, despite the inevitable sensation of treading water, we do get some nostalgic thrills similar to last episode. and once we finally catch up to where we left off last time, in the last 10 minutes or so, the episode becomes amazing and crazy and dark and mindblowing.ultimately, my opinion of this episode rests entirely on how the next one goes; sam has more to answer for than ever, and only a short time in which to do it. i have utter faith in that man, but lord how he vexes me. brilliantly foreshadows what we find out in 413
 when elliot talks to himself at the end, it basically explains who the real elliot is and what this other elliot is supposed to be. the foreshadowing to the full reveal is so brilliant it honestly speaks for itself. there are so many more connections i'm sure will be made in future rewatches through the series as a whole. domo arigato mr robato!!
 best intro in the series.
this episode was absolutely perfect in my opinion, too bad the episode after face planted a bit.
been waiting to hear mr roboto used in the show since it came out, busting it out like that while they're obviously doing a back to the future homage was just too perfect. very nice ending since eps 011 everything going to great end :)
 anyone else feel dark (german) series how he meet his other version also the music in the end :) goodbye, friend
 my heart feels very heavy after watching this finale. this show means so much to me and, as far as i'm concerned, no other show can connect with its audience like mr. robot did. as i sat watching this beautiful series come to a close with my cat elliot, i realized this show accomplished its message spectacularly, and it did so while preserving its legacy. well i guess it's time to get "mind awake, body asleep" tattooed on my ribs and complain on reddit about how underrated this show is. farewell to an exceptional masterpiece of storytelling and character insight. i speak for those who appreciate television as an art form, and therefore love this show, when i say mr. robot is a one-of-a-kind phenomenon that we were lucky to witness. thank you to everyone who worked on this show, every cast and crew member, and especially sam esmail. truly, thank you all for this show. it has helped so, so many people in coping with mental illness, and that is something these people should be immensely proud of. an emotionally and narratively satisfying conclusion
 wow. sam esmail has proved time and time again that he's a genius storyteller, but this might just take the cake. this episode hits the trifecta of things required for a truly perfect series finale; it's emotionally satisfying, narratively satisfying, and surprising. it's tremendously difficult to make something that you don't see coming but makes perfect sense; if it's perfectly logical, why wouldn't it occur to the viewer?in recent years, many writers have become obsessed with the need to surprise the audience (after all, it's boring if there are no surprises, right?) and have decided to prioritize it over crafting a good ending. narratives such as this can be fun in the moment, but often leave the viewer feeling shortchanged. the much harder path, the path this show opts for, is to create something that makes sense and then obscure it through clever misdirection, so the viewer never catches on but feels like they should have been able to once all is laid bare.it's risky; too subtle, and it doesn't feel foreshadowed. too blatant, and the viewer figures it out before the show reveals it (like when reddit predicted season 2's big twist after one episode). this episode reveals the show's big final twist, and esmail has been riding the line perfectly this whole time; all the way up to last episode, nothing made sense to me. but when the reveal happened in this episode, everything clicked and it led to a fantastic farewell.it's been an amazing journey; i reviewed the first episode on this site the day it came out, and i've reviewed every episode since. the show has helped me through some hard times, serving as the one constant in a sea of variables. ever since imdb removed the lower limit on the length of reviews, i've pretty much stopped writing them - but i had to finish this show out. now that it's over, you may never hear from me again. if this is the last we meet, then all i can say is...goodbye, friend. and like that, rome falls. hello elliot.
 it was an honor to be able to witness this show as it was airing, first of all.
mr robot will forever be with me and will forever be one of my favorite shows ever created.we find out the elliot we've been following all this time was not the real elliot, but an alternate version of the real one, created by his anger. this persona was so motivated to change the world, destroying all evil, that he took over (almosy) completely and locked the real elliot away, in a perfect loop where sexual abuse was never present, where his mother loved him, where he had friends, a life, and angela as his partner. but like our fake elliot said... real elliot did not have everything. he didn't have darlene, and after the conversation with darlene, fake elliot decides to finally give up control and let the real elliot come out. he accepts that he's just a part of him, and says his goodbyes to darlene. real elliot wakes up.
we watch as elliot sits besides the other alter egos.this was by far one of the best series finales i've ever seen, (i'm looking at you got.) we are taken on this journey with elliot and we discover the truth besides him. we are there with him, we want to know, and when we finally do... we are just as shocked as him. we don't want to let go. but we have to. our elliot has to.sometimes in life a gem like this will appear in our way, all we can do is sit back and watch as it completely blows our minds. mr.robot is that gem. back in 2015 when my friends told me to watch a show called mr.robot i never, in a million years expected anything quite like this. this show was masterfully crafted by sam esmail and masterfully acted by everyone involved. thank you for creating one of the most powerful series ever aired. a new bar in television is set.
 this is beyond words. i will never be the same after completing this. i have seen amazing television in my life but this is the best without a doubt. this is in a class of its own. a mind-bending, emotional, satisfying, and ultimately uplifting conclusion.
 i'm jumping for joy. sam esmail-you're a damn genius. the plotting, the brain-power, and the patience it must have took to calculate this story is mind-blowing.to know that elliot actually saved the world and saved himself all at the same time makes me so happy i could scream.thank you mr. robot for one of the most thrilling series of television of all time. i will miss you so much. one of the best series finales in television history
 this is easily one of the most amazing series finales in television history! we are given answers to all of our major questions surrounding elliot & everything is explained, connecting the entire show together and making it make sense. our elliot was never really elliot all along. everything on mr. robot actually did happen, but our elliot was the "mastermind" behind everything. he orchestrated all of these events we saw, after trapping the real elliot in his own "prison" world inside of his mind.the 5 personalities are: young elliot, elliot's mother, mr. robot, our elliot we followed the whole series, & the real elliot who woke up at the end. i've seen people say that we the viewers are the real elliot, but that is not true.there are quite a lot of things that don't actually end up getting explained at all, which really takes away from how great of an ending mr. robot has.we aren't shown who the real elliot is at the end. the "dream" our elliot was trapped in had made it seem like he didn't actually physically look like who the real elliot is (referring to when our elliot showed dom his id). but that contradicts the fact that the mastermind elliot came face to face with the real him and they did look alike. my only guess is that they do look alike and it was just a twisted part of the dream. i may just be stupid and totally misinterpreted this.the second is, what the hell was whiterose's machine? we were never told what the actual function or purpose of it was.. was whiterose just an insane person who was convinced of her machine actually working and creating a parallel world? i guess in the end it's not important, as the story was never about her machine, it was about elliot discovering who he actually is. i think the biggest takeaway here is that whiterose's machine represented her inability to admit that she wasn't a god and her not wanting to give up control is the cause of her downfall, whereas our elliot came to grips with having to give up control to the real him. i felt like these two characters were similar yet polar opposites throughout the show, so their endings staying true to that was beautiful.third, what the hell happened to tyrell!? the whole show we are seemingly led to believe he is an important character and will play a big role in the end, but that wasn't the case at all. what on earth was the blue light he encountered in the woods? was that just nothing of importance, was it meant to be symbolic? did he just end up dying offscreen? in the end i guess it's not important to how the show wrapped up, but i just wish they gave more definitive closure & explanation to tyrell's story.some other things that we were just never given answers to: what happened in those 3 missing days after the 5/9 attack? why did whiterose make it so her machine could be shut down by a 90's computer game? what was the significance of 11:16, which we saw so many times? why is elliot in the hospital and not jail after being found at a nuclear power plant that almost just had a meltdown, with the entire staff murdered and minister zhang found dead? too many important things not being answered definitively took away from my enjoyment of this series finale.i do think this was an absolute masterpiece of a series finale that tied together the whole show in a magnificent, shocking way, despite quite a few things not being answered. i'm left satisfied with how (what i consider to be) the best show in television history concluded, but am also left confused over the things i listed above.thank you sam esmail for creating a show that will be talked about for years to come and remembered as an all time great. thank you rami malek, carly chaikin, christian slater, & all the rest of the cast for bringing to life such amazing, memorable characters & giving emmy worthy performances over the years. i love mr. robot so much & am so grateful for this journey. all i have left to say is...goodbye, friend. what a beautiful wild rollercoaster of a show and finale.
 this show has changed my life. i didn't know what to expect in this finale or how they could end this wild show, but this finale broke me to pieces and built me up again to end on the perfect note. this was the only way this show could have ended.thank you to sam esmail, rami malik, mac quayle, tod campbell, portia doubleday, carly chaikin, martin wallstrom, christian slater, and usa network for making this show and being apart of this moment in television history. this show will go down as the best piece of television history, mark my words. goodbye, friend. profound
 i'm no critic, but as a human, i feel blessed to have been able to experience this. we may have just witnessed the most profound work of television in history just now. nothing will ever come close to this finale.
 to all the fans of this show,i don't know if there is anything that will ever match the feelings we felt in this last episode. gut-wrenching, heart pounding but absolute bliss in the end.an absolute masterpiece. this is officially the greatest tv show ever created
 the finale seals this for me. there has never been and never will be a greater work of art than mr. robot such a satisfying end to a great series
 i was completely blown away by this finale. people rating lower show in their descriptions complete lack of comprehension of the ending.for example, someone said it was lame that it was a "dream" the whole time. no. if that's what you took away from it you need to start the series over from the beginning because you didn't understand it. the big reveal is not that it was all a dream, it's that the elliot we knew wasn't the elliot we thought he was. despite him not being the "real" elliot, we still connected with the character in such a strong way. mastermind elliot was just as much a person as real elliot.the unanswered questions don't bother me. what did angela see? what was whiterose's machine? what was with the glowy thing tyrell saw? etc. if you're stuck on whether these questions were answered then you missed the whole point of the show entirely. all these things were subplots to what the show was really about: elliot's mental health and how he dealt with his trauma. and it was beautifully executed. i now want to rewatch the series. beautiful ending to an amazing show.
 this was a satisfying and emotional finale to a masterpiece of a show. very little will top this as this show is undoubtedly incredible. from the cinematography, music, writing and acting. everything is exceptional. the great thing about this show is that there is nothing like it, it is one of a kind and it is very unfortunate to see it go. thank you sam esmail, rami malek, christian slater and everyone else involved in this mr robot. one of if not the best endings to a series ever
 without a doubt the best tv show i've ever seen, and many others agree with me. this show was phenomenal since the very first episode. there will probably never be anything like this show. thank you sam email. this put esmail on my face!
 i stopped watching after season one, coz i thought they spoiled a great show on computer hacking by introducing psychological concepts. i was in only for the hacking and all the cool stuff.a few weeks back i chanced upon how high the recent episodes have been getting rated. that made me come back to this show and pick up from where i had left off, with a fresh perspective.and must i say, its has been one hell of a ride! there was always a thin dark cloud that has been wrapping the whole story up, few bits and pieces here and there that left us wondering what we were missing or what we are failing to expect.this episode finally blows all the smoke away, and bids us farewell in the most fitting way possible. in the end, elliot never knew we existed, and we never met elliot. absolute masterpiece
 perfect ending to a perfect show. this is one of the greatest tv shows ever made, and my favorite one. legendary work by sam esmail, rami malek, carly chaikin, christian slater, portia doubleday & co. goodbye, friend. 🙏🏼 the greatest finale to the greatest season of the greatest show
 genuinely the most beautiful, mind bending, tense, well written and satisfying conclusion to a show i've ever seen. rarely does a finale elevate the rest of the show but this episode makes every episode before it better by tenfold. what was one of the worst episodes of the series (in my opinion) elliot's withdrawal in season one is now one of the most important episodes of the show. on one hand i am frustrated by the secrecy of elliot's true self but on the other, this has never been about him, but his personalities building a better world for him and eventually losing control before accepting that their job is done and handing it back to the true elliot. it's equal parts heartbreaking and wholesome. mac quayle, thank you for your incredible symphonies helping establish the totalitarian techno thriller atmosphere that was an important staple of the show. thank you rami malek, christian slater, bd wong, portia doubleday carly chaikin and everyone else for bringing this incredible vision to fruition and making the characters your own. thank you to sam esmail for this unmatched masterpiece of television which i doubt i will see surpassed in my lifetime and thank you to the rest of the crew behind the scenes for the sound mixing, incredible editing and enchanting cinematography. this show makes you feel like you are apart of its world, because you are, remember, this only works if you let go too. goodbye, friend. best show since breaking bad
 'goodbye friend' titled review is simply the best what a have witnessed.
i hear you. this was quite a ride. no other show can surpass these expectations witch this show accoblished: bar is very high if there are shows in future witch are this good, intelligent and original. all i can say, this was an experience witch i have privileged to witness. thank you. goodbye friend!
 i will be short. i love everything about mr robot. just wanted to say thank you to everyone who is involved to this masterpiece. dats how you do it! the crazy thrilling journey in elliots mind has come to an end.
 i'll start from the end, the last scene, the last lyrics ..."i'm the king of my own land,
facing tempests of dust, i'll fight until the end,
creatures of my dreams, raise up and dance with me,
now and forever,
i'm your king."these were the lyrics of outro for m83, just to wrap up a perfect finale , emotionally heightened so intense and all focused into finally explaining who's the "real elliot".it's .. i can't really keep on repeating myself commending sam esmail, rami malek, christian slater and literally the whole cast .. it's just painful to see them go after 5 long years.so at the end, the whole series was a perfect melody that we'll all be remembering for years to come .. farewell mr. robot. the perfect finale
 this finale was very unexpected but it wrapped up the series perfectly. i love how it was hinted to throughout the show and you slowly put the puzzle pieces together and it makes sense. great job sam! the absolute greatest tv show of all time
 i just recently made an imdb account just so i could say that this episode is the greatest piece of tv ever. this show has continued to leave me shocked at its creativeness, its twists, and just every single thing it does. this episode in particular wraps everything up perfectly in a way that not only sends a powerful message, but also packs a heavy emotional punch. words cannot really describe how much i love this show and this may possibly be the greatest tv ending of all time. good bye friend !!
 i will remember this show for the rest of my life , what a ride that was , in the last two episodes when elliot found himself in a completely different world i didn't know what the hell was happening, i thought that it would be very disappointing if elliot is really in a different dimension or some parallel world and white rose's machine worked ! (well i like movies and shows with scientific stuff happening like that but it didn't fit in this show ! )we been experiencing elliot's condition and the story should stay like that and thanks sam esmail that's what happened, i really appreciate how the story ends with this astonishing twist at the end , it's really surprising to know that throughout the 4 seasons we have not actually met the real elliot !! who would have thought that ! thanks to sam esmail for this incredible work and i will miss the show so much , good bye my friend we see you soon 👋🏼👋🏼 the best payoff and the best finale i have ever witnessed, truly masterful
 this episode puts even the breaking bad finale to shame. my jaw was on the floor throughout the entire episode, i could not have wished for anything more beautiful. this was the most flawless episode i have ever seen (aside from the chernobyl finale, but i'm not gonna account miniseries here).i am not sure if i will ever witness anything like this ever again. thank you sam esmail for some of the most memorable hours, some of the most mindboggling twists, some of the most intense nailbiters and some of the most emotion payoffs in television history.thank you. what a great time to be alive
 it's 5 am and i've just finished this piece of art and i'm wordless.
i don't think that i could experience something like this again, but i'm so happy to still alive.now, i love being human friend, it's a new-class-defining piece of television
 this finally wraps up almost all missing parts you needed to understand the storyline since episode 1x1 till now, and it was extraordinary beautiful.what's unique and brilliant about mr. robot is that each episode gives parts to understand every past episode better and deeper. the complete truth is not wrapped untill this astonishing finale.sam esmail had a very complicated story, that's not right to put it in an ordinary show frame; it got to be told with this brilliant storytelling.
very good thing also that esmail committed to this great story, with no decline, and keeping it all real.many people got worried about twisting the show into a sci-fi/fantasy show because of the last two episodes, or giving some illogical explain for these episodes, however esmail did an excellent job with writing, keeping it all real and giving missing pieces to all puzzles we got so far.mr. robot has to be a classic television series for this century, that defines a new school of tv. rami malek and the great cast should be remembered forever for being in this extraordinary piece of art. crap 90's sitcom bit
 this just isn't creative and doesn't drive the plot forward. it's unecessary at best. still here but wondering why
 i've watched season 2 this far only because season 1 was so good. the writers don't seem to know what to do since the hackers accomplished their mission in season 1.most of season 2 has been spent inside elliot's head or introducing new characters that are annoying (fbi woman) or don't advance the main story (evil website guy and leon) or compromising angela. the writing has dropped off a cliff since the end of the first season.the only good part of season 2 for me has been seeing darlene and elliot coming up with the grand scheme of season 1. the beginning of this episode is the low point thus far of season 2. a 15 minute diversion that doesn't advance anything. i was waiting for it to end so something might meaningful might happen in the show's reality.it's getting harder to keep faith as this season continues (to go nowhere). from funny to too brutal
 spoiler alert, of course the following text can contain details from what happened on the show. so this episode really took me by surprise with the beginning as a family sitcom where elliot was just rolling his big eyes most of the time. but this was actually the better part of the episode, i even laughed a bit which since the first season happened very rarely. but when it came back to the normal resolution and reality it got worse. it really broke my heart how bad elliot ended up from helping that ray guy. like seriously isn't he already dealing with enough sh*t in his life? he has to get beat up like some street dog by this bunch of idiots who are selling guns and god knows what else online? i think you took it too far here sam! i am already hurting a lot watching elliot suffer through most of the time but this just got too violent. also angela is getting on my nerves,with her listening to the pathetic motivational crap all the time thinking that she can accomplish anything. it just makes her appear more stupid and naive than before. overall i am having hard time continuing to watch this show, but just for the awesome acting job by rami malek i will keep on watching. joanna coerces elliot to help her find tyrell as multiple characters maybe meeting death or jail time.
 trigger warning(s): gun shotsmain plot (with commentary)topic 1: an unlikely team (elliot & joanna)joanna's driver is a menacing man, and perhaps the sole reason elliot even entertains joanna. someone who, despite seemingly ready to divorce the man, is trying to claim how much she loves him and how this breathing on the phone must be him right? surely elliot, the master hacker, can find her husband? well, little does she know her husband is dead and she is a widow but mr. robot doesn't think it is smart to reveal such information. {commentary}as usual, joanna remains a bit of an outlier. to me, she is the only character who hasn't really become someone you get an emotional reaction of. she is still the hot wife, as is reinforced by her mostly appearing in sexual situations and not even in a femme fatale type of way. but maybe one day she may evolve. switching to elliot, the old boy has a few new toys thanks to joanna pushing him to help her. but what is perhaps noteworthy here is joanna's driver. this mysterious bodyguard dude has this vibe that he may be an undercover agent. one who could be, long term, trying to catch wind of where tyrell maybe and with elliot, thanks to hacking the nypd, gets a ping, off that man goes. leaving elliot to deal with an old friend.topic 2: the end of the line (cisco, angela, dominique, and darlene)it all had to catch up to them sooner or later right? cisco hanging with darlene, who is losing it and, as cisco says, has masqueraded as a leader and has done so terribly. after all, trenton and mobley have taken off to the wind, when vincent, one of the dc operatives, shows up her first thought seems to be letting him die, and it shows darlene has gone off the deep end. though all things considered, she may have been screwed up for a while. take for example how fondly she remembers being kidnapped and almost wishing she wasn't fond. for, outside of missing elliot, she liked the change of pace.well, it may be time for elliot to miss her. for, you see, with multiple people identifying cisco, and the fbi deciding to use the media to smoke him out, well the dark army possibly gets involved. we still can't say the men whose faces we never see are part of the dark army, but considering the same night cisco face is revealed they go to the diner he and darlene are at and shoot it up, needless to say, there is a likely chance these soldiers are the fingers of white rose. but who survived? well, dominique, after following many bread crumbs to find cisco and darlene, she makes it out alive. however, it isn't clear if the shooter got his target, much less darlene. so, it is going to be one of two things: either one or both will end up in the hospital or elliot might be planning a funeral. which will be the 2nd downer of the night for angela, under the alias claudia kincaid, reveals dominique is onto her and she is prepping to admit to her part in the f-society and 5/9 attacks. she isn't going to mention elliot or his friends, but she does want to know before it goes down, why did he start f-society? of which an answer isn't really given. however, with this being a real possible goodbye, for a while, a hug turns into a kiss and then comes what may be the final stop in their relationship. for once elliot gets off that empty train car, either the fbi or dark army get on and that leads to another character maybe at the end of the line.{commentary}will they actually kill off a lead character? gideon's death was a shock, but honestly, i forgot about it until i started thinking of who else died on this show. but gideon's death didn't send shock waves. his death seemed to just signify it was the end of his story and, at that point, he was just fat on the meat. when it comes to this situation, though, the people who might be killed, or imprisoned, are a bit more essential.granted, killing cisco would be the easy choice. but then you have to factor how darlene will react. arguably, even more so than elliot, cisco grounds her. yes, he may fight with her constantly, but he tries to gear her toward normalcy and chilling out. that is, as opposed to elliot who, in my opinion, perhaps took advantage of her need for his approval and companionship. hence why, when he disappeared, she took over. not because she perhaps fully believes in the goal to take down e-corp as he does, but because she knows this project is important to him and she doesn't want to have him have one less reason to come back.yet, honestly, it seems unlikely that either she or angela may be in mortal danger. for while this season has done its best to make a compelling twist and shock us, it hasn't really done it well. it has often picked the safest route and chosen whatever can best fill the episode order of the show. so for them to kill one of the two female leads, i don't think mr. robot, as a show, has the guts. highlightsdominique finally being on the brink of catching a member, and an accomplice, of f-society.low pointsjoanna's existence on this show feels purely as eye candy and not as an actual contributor.on the fencewhat will happen with angela, darlene, and cisco? are they about to die, go to jail, or will something else happen to them? we learn who kidnapped angela and elliot meets up with an old friend.
 overviewbecause of mr. robot's format, we are in a constant state of questioning what is real or not? heck, maybe even what is embellished or not. so when you see white rose, is she real? when elliot sees anyone, be it the characters we believe to be alive or otherwise, are they who they appear to be? we, as viewers, are in a constant state of trusting what our eyes see as we peer through a blindfold. but if that blindfold is ever untied, will we like what we see?trigger warning(s): child abusetopic 1: stalling (dominique)what happened to cisco and darlene? dominique notes because of santiago's call people died in the shootout, yet she also mentions wanting to handle the questioning before she is sent home. a place where you can tell, she tries to avoid being for too long for who is there but alexa? what is there besides reminders of how lonely and unfulfilling her personal life is?{commentary}i'm trying to understand the purpose of us seeing dom's personal life. granted, i often complain about underdeveloped characters, but really what was the point of reminding us how miserable she is outside of work? especially when it isn't showing a different facet to her loneliness or even show her pursuing trying to get out there? i mean, even if it showed her trying to befriend angela that would have been something better than nothing.topic 2: why is this girl so special? (angela & white rose)speaking of angela, rather than the fbi picking her up it's the dark army on white rose's orders. leading to a very strange, mini-angela asking angela weird questions like if she cries during sex to basic ones like her picking between two colors. all of it is just a preface for white rose deciding to appear and meet angela.why exactly? well, because she seems like the type who would have been dead a long time ago. in fact, white rose says she should have been 90 days ago but now, she is worth 28 minutes of white rose's time to understand what makes this girl so interesting. of which, between the washington township incident, the 5/9 attacks, and all that happened in between and since, seems to be what makes her amusing. to the point, white rose won't kill her as long as she stops interfering. which she is to convince herself of not doing whichever way she needs to.{commentary}angela's place on this chessboard which is mr. robot has her going back and forth between a back row piece to a pawn. which ultimately i realize is to the benefit to whoever she shares a scene with more than her. take wong as white rose for example.but, their shared scenes aside, you have to be left wondering what is angela foiling and does it deal with stage 2? is it that a nuclear meltdown of an e-corp asset is the goal? perhaps the power outs are supposed to open up the ability to really do some damage to the e- corp servers, especially as mr. price tries to position e-coin as a currency which can help the banking system recover? as with most theories, i bet you that in the season finale we will get a watered down answer if we get one at all.topic 3: can you believe your eyes? (elliot)what is it mr. robot sees? what is it he does while elliot is asleep, dazed, or left himself vulnerable enough to be taken over? well, with the glitches allowing elliot to see mr. robot as he possesses him, acts as him, elliot tries to consciously do as mr. robot does and become a silent watcher. something he does and this reveals tyrell? is he real? is he alive? elliot tries to get this answer from a 3rd party but with that person being a taxi driver with little patience, he isn't for elliot losing his mind over thinking tyrell is in the back seat.what really matters here though is tyrell says, per dark army, preparation for stage 2 is complete.{commentary}a part of me wants to believe tyrell is real. after all, mr. robot perhaps would need him to be real and elliot to believe he is dead so tyrell could work uninterrupted. plus, let's face it, when it comes to elliot's memory issues, more than likely mr. robot is the culprit of all that so that elliot can't stop whatever he has in motion. after all, be it elliot or the manifestation which is mr. robot, this is all about revenge more than anything else, even if elliot and darlene attempt to make it seem like it isn't. white rose pointed that out herself.but what is stage 2 remains in the air and why would tyrell be needed for it? fingers crossed, let's hope for some answers. highlightsthough mr. wong's performance on gotham is campy to the point he just blends in, as white rose he is too brilliant to not stand out. white rose is sarcastic yet not mean-spirited and has this air of mystery not only when it comes to her person but with how amused she is with the world. add in the complications of her dual life and you have to applaud mr. wong's work on this character for even if the foundation was excellent, he made her into a skyscraper worthy of awe.on the fenceto me, mr. robot should have remained at an episode order of 10 instead of 12. for really, what has been done with the extra time? granted, some of the filler, like the 90s sitcom version of mr. robot, was funny, but alongside that comes the arc featuring ray which, at this point, was purely a time killer. mr. robot finally became boring
 i've been a fan of the show since it started and recommended to everyone as the best show of all time, but personally i think sam esmail run out of ideas and has been watching black mirror too much. i'm 30 minutes into this episode and i'm annoyed by how the episode keeps running with side stories leaving elliot aside. i watch the show to see mr robot, not a messy fbi agent talking to her alexa about love. the conversation between whiterose and amanda is totally pointless. i sure can come out with a billion more creative ideas of how to mess up with a viewer mind instead of the whole locked in a door with a commodore. jumping the shark
 it's hard to write that title. i mean, for a show that is about hacking the fbi, and a nerd being desired by every beautiful women out there, is hard to say... but the angela story in this was... so disappointing... the season finale is more so a whimper than a roar as you are left feeling there should be one more episode left before the real finale.
 trigger warning(s): violence against a womantopic 1: happiness makes up in height for what it lacks in length (joanna)scott knowles (cto of e-corp) wanted revenge. so he impersonated tyrell hoping to force joanna to feel his pain. problem is, she isn't impressed and, unlike him, she isn't made weak by her disappointment. no, it makes her vicious and she notes how his wife was going to have an affair, that his unborn baby is better off dead than having him as a father, and it leads to scott snapping. he nearly kills her but stops. something he may wished he had done for joanna, it seems, is going to use derek to frame scott for his wife's death.{commentary}is it wrong i was hoping joanna was going to be killed off? her scene with scott seemed like the perfect sendoff but, alas, it seems season 3 she shall return for her revenge. all the while remaining in the shadow of being tyrell's wife, even after a full season without him.topic 2: let's be friends (dominique & darlene)it's a stalemate. dominque doesn't have the evidence she needs to manipulate darlene and darlene feels confident enough about her chances in prison to keep a tight lip. thus leaving dominique to hope her "good cop" or "let's be friends" tactic actually works on someone. for, as of now, while dominique has evidence, and pretty much knows most of the f-society's connections, without darlene all she has are dead bodies and missing persons.{commentary}with cisco dead, that leaves elliot as the one person who darlene not only trusts, but loves. so comes the question if she may sacrifice herself, thinking elliot will clear her record eventually, or if she'll work with dom solely to protect her brother. two scenarios which seem as unlikely as they could be options. for where else could they go with this storyline? besides the dark army swooping in and trying to kill everyone in that fbi location. which, while mind blowing, honestly would feel like a jumping the shark type moment.topic 3: can you trust yourself (elliot, mr. robot, and tyrell)stage 2 deals with killing the hope of mr. price rebuilding the database by destroying all the physical records of e-corp. all of which, from across the country, are being shipped to one central location. all that has to be done is use the backdoor elliot created, use the femcell he also made, then overload the ups systems to release a gas which, when they explode, will cause a fire and level the building and everyone in it.which is the problem for elliot – the death of people. making it so as he realizes what mr. robot has planned with multiple parties, including what he believes is a fake tyrell, he tries to stop them both. leading to the truth being revealed: tyrell is alive. he shoots elliot with the gun mr. robot gave him for no one is supposed to be allowed to stop the project, even himself (elliot/mr. robot).so, as elliot lies on the ground, bleeding out, tyrell calls angela and with that she calmly reassures tyrell and we begin to realize that mr. robot has planned farther ahead than given credit for. he has made use of elliot's body in ways we can't truly fathom and he somehow has even got angela wrapped around his finger.{commentary}as interesting as stage 2 seems you know it isn't going to happen, leading to the only interesting thing here being angela's role in all this. who prepped her, why did she accept, and could it just be she has become a dark army soldier for protection? outside of that, you have to wonder if that bullet maybe all elliot needed to get rid of mr. robot. someone who flickers like a glitch, post-gunshot, until he eventually disappears.but if he isn't gone, you have to wonder if that means we basically are just going to see the same thing we saw this season? is elliot going to od on adderall to combat mr. robot as he tries to fight not only tyrell and the progress of stage 2, but also the dark army? leading to the question, how does this benefit the dark army? granted, destroying the paper trail covers whiterose's alter ego, but it isn't the property is some warehouse. it is a nuclear power plant. overall though, it is strange when a season finale feels like the episode before one. for while it is nice we have some idea where season 3 is going to go, i honestly don't feel all that excited for it.things to notetrenton (tanya) and mobley (frederick) are seen in a post-credits scene and leon walks up on them asking for the time. leading you to believe whiterose has been recruiting heavily, or this is another trick from the writers.highlightsoutside of the surprises dealing with angela and leon, and maybe joanna and scott's scene, there isn't much to praise here.low pointswith mr. robot cutting the social commentary and philosophy of season 1, so came a show more about fostering distrust and splitting the focus too thin. leading to weak mysteries like if tyrell was alive, to multiple episodes wasted in the ray arc. ultimately making season 2 feel like an unnecessary sequel to a rather brilliant movie.on the fencewhich isn't to say the season was outright horrible. dominique was a welcome new addition, even if the constant reminders of her loneliness went nowhere. plus whiterose, with her musings, made up for elliot's memory loss and trickery. not to forget, the whole concept of how everyone wears a mask was very appealing until it was forgotten to focus on "what is stage 2?" a good episode but not such a good season finale
 the first season of mr.robot was great and had an impressive finale. when the second season began i was afraid this show was following "hannibal"s steps and was going to turn into something boring and disappointing, fortunately i was dead wrong. after the first 3 or 4 episodes this season was turning out to be really good and a breath of fresh air. although the show is sometimes difficult to understand, even cryptic at times, it is all revealed in the end. about this season's finale, it offers some sort of closure to the tyrell wellick mystery as it shows him alive and well but it also shows the never ending struggle between elliot and his other personality(his dead father) as well as the apparent demise of the fsociety. i am not happy with what kind of personality angela turned out to have or with the tyrell saying about elliot "i love him!" or with the little clichè from elliot and angela, the childhood friends who turn out to be in love with each other. over all, season 2 was above my expectations and the season finale(i though it was going to be really packed with action) was a really good episode but the season deserved a better ending. season 2 - 8.8 season 2 finale - 9.3 will not be watching on a week-to-week basis next season
 mr. robot should have ended at s1 because s2 is a complete u-turn. the show is no longer targeted at the general viewer but viewers that have a high tolerance for the shows ridiculously slow story progression, theory enthusiasts, and viewers that love 'emotional development' (by that i mean the ever-so frequent 5 minute long stares characters like angela are seen doing).season 2 overall is not a season for the average viewer. from the get go you will notice the massive (and negative) change from s1 to s2 in terms of the exaggerated cinematography, extreme lack of story progression, and misuse of emotional development as mentioned above. you will find yourself painfully forcing your way through the first 5 episodes for the story-line to actually begin, and by the end of the season you will ask yourself -- "did i really just put myself through those painful episodes for that?".ultimately, i will not be watching this show on a week-to-week basis as i have done since season 1. with that said, i feel absolutely no excitement to watch season 3. and i will most likely stop watching it completely if they continue with this new approach.fix up. your rating is going down for a reason. good season, not a great finale
 season 2 finale of mr robot was fine but the setup of the characters were weak at times. still a good season but i am excited to head into season 3. a great starter to season 3, but...
 compared to the slow pace of its earlier season, season 3 immediately redeems itself with the fast pace first episode, 'power saver mode'. the characters have become more intense - one terrified to the point of breakdown - by the results of their actions from season 2, inherently providing a much more entertaining show which has you hooked from the beginning. my favourite scene being a brief look at underground hackers competing against each other in a part-club-part-lan-party style venue. i'd love to see more of this culture within the series.as another reviewer has already mentioned however, writer and director sam esmail has decided to throw an immense amount of unnecessary political bias into this episode, by associating the collapse of the entire world economy with donald/ivanka trump, fox news, and other conservatives, who - along with elliot - have inherently kickstarted the entire downfall of human civilisation. these types of references are ridiculous at best, and destroy what is essentially a good show. the writers would be better off sticking to what is essentially a fictional story and not adding in propaganda for the sake of pleasing their hollywood-bubble buddies. was good, until it was trump-derangement-syndromed
 when a fictional show based in a fictional universe i'm wholly immersed in makes me pause it to google what the frack is going on with political digs hammered in like a shoehorn being jack-hammered into the space between two atoms it becomes awful.likening trump's entirely legal and methodical election victory to the results of complete society-breakdown is so far out there that the only conclusion is that sam ishmael suffers from complete tds. a solid character-based middle episode.
 this episode has none of the in-your-face stylish quality or deliberate sense of perplexing mystery that i love so much about this show, and it was far from my favourite episode as a result. however, i can't deny that this episode was necessary and that it probably couldn't have been executed any better. it's 45 minutes of fleshing out characters, relationships, and plots; shuffling pieces along the board without incident. not exciting, but presumably vital to later events in the season.although several characters get significantly developed in this episode, the most interesting (and the one with the most screen time) is darlene. she shows her dark side to a random woman on the train, mends her relationship with elliot, and laments her situation over drinks with dom. i already thought she was in a very interesting position between story lines at the start of this season, and this episode made things even more interesting, showing her and her motivations from multiple angles.the primary source of tension in this episode arises from the cat-and-mouse game between elliot, mr. robot, darlene, angela, dom, and tyrell. they each have their own agenda and it's fascinating to watch them weave around each other trying to achieve it, putting themselves or each other at risk and interacting in new and unexpected ways. these manoeuvres ultimately don't lead to anything particularly significant in this episode, but i'm sure they'll result in some major stuff down the line. for now, it's entertaining enough just to watch them do it.on the whole, i didn't mind this episode. it just didn't get me very excited, either. i enjoyed it fine for what it was, but i hope the coming episodes pick up the pace and bring back the stylishness. boring, predictable, the series is going no where
 really, people are on edge over this? gee, they didn't kill elliot darlene or the fbi chick. shocker!! i was hoping they might, then this series might not be so predictable and boring. what was interesting has turned into boredom. what made game of thrones entertaining is that they killed off main characters. this series is so mainstream predictable, does anyone even think they'd kill darlene? i want them to!! please, kill darlene!!!oh hey, elliot has another computer hack....zzzzzzzzzzzz. he's the smartest hack around.....zzzzzzzzzz.it just keeps dragging on. he has control of the dark army...and does nothing with it. if you're seriously entertained by where this series has gone, i suggest watching any sitcom. not the usual
 what happened to the season 1 twists? that was a great season but this is so predictable and stupid.
wtf was that when leon killed the chinese? what is the point of his character? didn't he used to serve them?to be honest the start of the season was so good and getting better and better until e8 or 9, i completely lost my interest in the series.i really hope season 4 would surprise me like season 1 average
 beside the fact that it's finally rose's background. it's just another good episode of the show but nothing special. season 3 was a lot more interesting. brilliant cinematography, some humour but overall no real plot progression
 positives:
1-fantastic cinematography
2-the woman who was trying to give them directions was really funnynegatives:
1-no real plot progression
2-some of it just felt like filler, did not learn anything we did not already know (for example about dom).this wasn't a horrible episode by any means, it was ok & i can understand why some people really liked it, but it just wasn't my type of my episode. the first three episodes were far superior in my opinion. filler episode in the final season
 this episode didn't really advance the plot that much there was a lot of wasted run time between darlene and the drunk santa and elliot and tyrell. the only truly important thing is tyrell being shot at the end of the episode and seeing something that i guess we will see next episode or two. waste of valuable time!
 what is the value added of darlene's story in this episode? and also this cheap drama between elliot and tyrell just to lead us to the moment of tyrell being shot! it was a cheap try to create an emotional moment between them disappointed
 several series i watch had an off week this week, including mr. robot. this season is the climax of the series, so i'm surprised they had enough time to create an episode that accomplishes so little -- on the surface, anyway. i'll watch the episode again to see if i overlooked something deeper.unimportant detail: why the change in episode naming this season? mac quayle used the same style for the cuts on his soundtrack for the season. somehow, the show producers didn't join in. impressive cinematography glossing over a weak plot
 a number of really eye-pleasing scenes, particularly those shots of the foggy forest glistening under the moonlight. but apart from that and a couple of humorous twists, i found myself bored and tempted to fast forward.things were made worse by the petulant millennial behavior some of the main characters (darlene, tyrell) have evolved to represent. i'd tolerate some over-dramatic complaining if the plot was strong enough to keep me hooked, but in such a filler episode it was just unbearable, at least for me. stupid ending.
 never in life would elliot go after _krista in the end. he knew he would be caught and kidnapped. he had much more urgents things to do. not acceptable is a fitting title
 i feel the writers dropped the ball in a specific manner in this episode. the use of krista as the pawn in a cooked up scheme by fernando vera to get to elliot was an illogical plot twist at face value.when a sweaty looking fernando vera, played by elliot villar, recounts a long winded parable of a "a bully and a lil bitch", a bound and gagged krista squirms and moans in terror. i immediately wonder why gloria reuben the actor has been reduced to this bs. the torture in this scene is conveyed mostly through language. sam esmail and his writing staff (amelia gray) must think they created an "edgy" script with vera's akward use of the n word for "dramatic" emphasis without any contextual reason provided for its use. entitled tone deafness on behalf of the writers while crafting these scenes was most likely at a fever pitch.the whole story line of vera and krista was full of double entendre. the image of 3 people of african descent (krista and vera's 2 loyal henchmen) in a room being fed the moral of the story, "...that is how you own a (insert racial slur)". so this elaborate return of vera seems mad suspect. is this monologue for krista, continuing the momentum from the last episode or is this some not-so-crafty message to the audience. i saw it as an example of the latter. a refreshing change of pace
 for at least the last five episodes, esmail has been leaning hard on the gas; we've been rocketing through the plot with episode after episode of dark, intense, edge-of-your-seat action. now, for the first time since "404 not found", we get a slower, more character-driven episode. if this had been located anywhere else in the season, it might have been really frustrating, but coming down off the high of 409 with another 3 to go after it, the episode feels perfectly placed.other than a tiny bit of elliot near the start, this episode is focussed entirely on dom and darlene, and their relationship. we also get cameos from two ex-dark army operatives. for the most part, this is a pretty lighthearted episode, but it definitely has some heavier moments as dom and darlene unpack their baggage. the ending is both hilarious and frustrating.i find it really interesting how the two slowest episodes of this season are both road trip episodes centered around a popular gay ship in the fandom - "404 not found" with tyrelliot, and "410 gone" with domlene. if the episode hadn't been released during finals week, when i'm super busy and didn't have time to actively anticipate it, maybe i would have felt more unsatisfied. as it was, i found it to be a tasty appetizer for the fast-approaching conclusion. worst episode of the series
 there's simply no excuse for the horrrrible choice of music at the end of this episode nor for the cliche-esque running-through-the-airport scene. airport scene was not necesssary,
 the airport scene was really lame, if this wasnt the end of the series i would stop watching right way bad
 writing your way out of such a grand climax is hard. we saw this stinker come from a mile away, and here it is in all of it's smelly glory. worst episode of the series
 this episode was really bad. it was like one of those romantic comedies. filler episodes on mr. robot were supposed to be great
 here's a quick reminder from season 3 episode 8, which for me is the best filler episode on mr robot. emotional and heartbreaking, rami malek totally nailed it and the episode itself had some substance to the plot. not only that but the cinematography was on point (as always).this is a complete slowed down and almost useless fan service episode just to feed the forced relationship between darlene and dominique. no mean to sound harsh about it but i feel time is running and there's only 3 episodes left to give closure to the series. that explains the frustration and overeaction about it, because the choice of music was actually quite nice (the hall & oates song is still stucked in my head). the scenes with leon were just gold and the reappereance of irving was intriguing.there's still hope of course because after rewatching this episode made me hating it less than the first time. still so many wrong choices and so less time till the end. fingers crossed for the next one because the trailer is promising. boring
 very boring. not much else to say. could've had that episode done in 5mins didn't like the latter part of the episode
 the part about the parallel universe makes robbing the deus group and the wealth redistribution events pointless. i really liked elliot's life in the parallel universe. it's the life he dreamt of, but getting there through a parallel universe is not satisfying. an ending in the real world would make more sense and it'll be a perfect ending to the show. a little worried
 i really dont like this "sci-fi" turn of the story in this episode. i really hope this is somehow in elliots mind (which is a strong possibility) according to the story so far. i mean the whole parallel worlds theory makes elliots struggle so far, a bit pointless. if thats the case ,whiteroses machine worked ,so the congo project cancelation was a bit pointless too. mr robot so far had logical and humble explanations to give about the acts of the protagonists .from child abuse to multiple personalities disorder all makes common sense, but this goes beyond the reasoning so far. i really want elliots struggle to end with his innermost effort and not with some ex machina trick from a plot we all missed from the beginning. i really hope this is a trick whiterose pulled like in angelas case and sam wants to make us believe in it like angela did ,because otherwise it is a bit ruined for me . the absolute lowest point
 overall the 4th season was clearly conceived to be able to bring mr robot to its end. this episode clearly marks an all time low. writers being lost. we've seen so much alternate story lines since star trek tos that it shows writers cramping for storyline. mr robot should've ended mid season 3. i pity the smashing cast that show a clear loss with this episode as well. disappointed in no hidden eggs
 elliot's parents house number is 229, it would have been better if it was 232 like rs-232his parents car license plate could have been something creative, like tcp- udp
